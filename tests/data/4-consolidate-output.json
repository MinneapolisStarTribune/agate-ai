    "text": "A driver was on his phone when he hit and killed a woman walking across a street in Wright County, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nJonathan William Edwards, 46, was charged Monday in Wright County District Court with criminal vehicular homicide in connection with the crash that occurred on Sept. 4 in Howard Lake on Hwy. 12 near 11th Avenue. Barbara Jean Hoppe, 85, of Howard Lake, Minn., was killed.\n\nEdwards, also of Howard Lake, was charged by summons and is due in court on May 9. Court records do not list an attorney for him. Messages were left Thursday seeking his response to the allegations.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Police Chief David Thompson was the first in law enforcement to respond to the scene about 2:48 p.m., where he saw an unresponsive Hoppe down in the road with head and arm injuries. Emergency responders took Hoppe to HCMC, where she was declared dead that afternoon.\n\nEdwards\u2019 van was stopped nearby in the eastbound lane of Hwy. 12. Edwards told police that Hoppe was in the middle of the street and not in the crosswalk. He said he locked up his brakes just before he struck her.\n\nA State Patrol sergeant watched video from a nearby gas station that showed Hoppe leave her home, then \u201cstanding at the crosswalk waiting for traffic on Hwy. 12 to clear,\u201d the complaint read. \u201cMs. Hoppe is seen on the video footage walking across Hwy. 12 within the marked and painted crosswalk.\u201d\n\nThe video captured Edwards\u2019 van nearing the crosswalk and \u201cnot slowing until the last moment when the brakes were abruptly applied,\u201d the complaint continued. The van hit Hoppe and sent her airborne.\n\nA second patrol sergeant checked Edwards\u2019 phone, and it showed an outgoing call to a bank at 2:46 p.m., \u201cvery near when the crash was reported to law enforcement,\u201d the complaint noted.\n\nEdwards claimed the phone was connected to a Bluetooth device, which would have allowed for hands-free calling. However, Edwards\u2019 van did not have any Bluetooth devices connected to it.",

    "text": "As fire and violence have raged through the Twin Cities, Pimento Jamaican Kitchen and Rum Bar has tried to help its community by serving as a pop-up food shelf.\n\nTo keep going, co-owner Tomme Beevas said he's had to turn it into something \"like a Fort Knox fortress.\" Beevas' business along Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis has been overwhelmed with volunteers \u2014 growing from about seven people standing guard to more than 250 vigilantly watching from rooftops, street corners and alleyways.\n\nThe same has happened in neighborhoods across the Twin Cities \u2014 from Little Earth to Longfellow \u2014 as residents have galvanized after several long nights of worry about what could happen at a time when first responders have been spread thin.\n\n\"Let's be clear,\" Beevas said. \"We know that the police will not be there to protect us.\"\n\nWhen the word got out about Pimento being targeted with threats from white supremacists on social media, he said, the community came out to protect the safe space that's providing supplies and food to protesters and those in need.\n\n\"We knew that by taking that leadership role, we would naturally become a target. And so we've been prepared and planning for it accordingly,\" he said. \"We are holding steadfast, full speed ahead with taking care of our people and taking care of our community.\"\n\nIn and around Little Earth, neighbors and members of the American Indian Movement on Saturday patrolled streets and redirected incoming traffic after the 8 p.m. curfew to protect elders and children living in the south Minneapolis neighborhood. Several volunteer EMS workers from the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe traveled 200 miles south to assist. Food shelf donations poured in.\n\nBobby Headbird said on Saturday evening that about 150 people were out protecting the surrounding Native American community with volunteers coming from Mille Lacs, Red Lake and Wisconsin.\n\n\"Leech Lake Twin Cities office was vandalized a little bit, but the neighbors are \u2026 standing out back in the alleyways out here protecting the neighborhood,\" he said. \"Now it's all boarded up and so now we're out here just making sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nWhile community members across Minneapolis came out to clean up neighborhoods after nights of unrest this week, the number out to guard against violence has swelled on subsequent nights.\n\nYouths in Cedar-Riverside lined the streets from Saturday evening to 6 a.m. Sunday.\n\nHesen Shire, owner of West Bank Furniture, said he hasn't seen any law enforcement along Cedar Avenue where businesses \u2014 many Somali-owned \u2014 are boarded up. He has called police but no one has come, he said.\n\nInstead, around 50 young people of different backgrounds and ethnicities came to support the neighborhood and keep it safe. Those efforts, he said, made a difference, noting Sunday morning that the situation on the street looked better despite recovering from vandals looting his store.\n\n\"This is life. Sometimes we struggle,\" he said. \"It's a difficult time, but we still fight. This is history.\"\n\nLongfellow residents coordinated efforts to block off side streets using caution tape, sawhorses and makeshift barricades to protect residential areas from rioters. Some communicated over handheld radios to alert one another about incoming danger. Some were armed with bats.\n\nHillary Oppmann watched vandals loot the corner Walgreens for three straight nights without interference before arsonists finally lit it on fire. It took more than seven hours for firefighters to make it to the scene.\n\n\"We can't lose any more community assets, like our libraries, pharmacies and post office,\" said Oppmann, who lives three doors down from Lake Street. \"They were simply left to burn.\"\n\nIn north Minneapolis, residents guarded what remained on the area's main commercial drag after several businesses along W. Broadway burned down.\n\nEli Darris of the ACLU Minnesota said the community patrolling effort came about out of a need to take care of critical infrastructure while standing up for justice.\n\n\"At the end of us making sure that we're standing up against the senseless, reckless and inhumane taking of our brother's life, we still want to make sure that our grandmas, our aunties, our uncles, our nephews are gonna have banks to go to, grocery stores to go inside of and shop, and what we've noticed is a very well-orchestrated, well-coordinated intentional attack against black businesses. And we made a determination that we will no longer allow these insidious rubes to come into our community,\" he said.\n\nBeevas at Pimento has the same mind-set of attending to immediate needs like protecting and feeding the neighborhood while striving for long-term change. As far as community policing efforts, he said neighbors should continue to look out for one another.\n\nStarting next weekend, Beevas said he's hosting a \"Pimento Summit\" to engage with community leaders and discuss meaningful legislation so that what happened to Floyd never happens again.\n\nHe said Pimento has traditionally stayed out of politics. But as a black-owned business in the city where Floyd's death occurred, he said they must rise to action.\n\n\"We are the ones being targeted by the system as black men \u2026 so if we don't speak up, who will speak up on our own behalf?\" he said. \"We are optimistic at Pimento that there is no better place for ground zero of this revolution than Minneapolis.\"\n\nStaff writers Liz Sawyer, Ryan Faircloth, Briana Bierschbach, Libor Jany and Matt McKinney contributed to this report.

She said her mom had been banished from the reservation due to two raids at her house.\n\n\u201cShe was in [the jail] for trespassing, and then my dad was in there for aiding and abetting for hiding her,\u201d Powers said.\n\nRed Lake legal counsel Joe Plumer said in response to an email inquiring on Hanson\u2019s banishment that he cannot share information on the matter until the FBI investigation is complete, which he said may take up to a month.\n\nBetty Ann Hanson was informed of her husband\u2019s in-custody death while she was in jail and released on furlough the following day to make funeral arrangements.\n\nIn online tributes, many in the Red Lake community affectionately called Robin Hanson by his nickname, \u201cFats.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe used to be chubby back in the day, and everyone just knows him as this really nice person,\u201d Powers said. \u201cHe always would do something for you if you needed it. He fixed cars, give you rides. He was just a really great person.\u201d\n\nPowers said other families were at the protests Tuesday who have lost loved ones in custody at the jail.\n\nDwan White Owl died in 2023 and Joseph Fairbanks Jr. in 2022. The FBI did not say whether those inmate deaths remain under investigation.\n\nAccording to an online fundraiser made by White Owl\u2019s family, \u201cshe passed while in custody at the Red Lake Jail to negligence in the arms of her daughter Danitra [Warpaint]. Our family is asking for justice for the inhumane treatment she received while in the care of the Red Lake Tribal Jail.\u201d\n\nFairbanks\u2019 family filed a wrongful death lawsuit last year against the jail and BIA. The lawsuit accuses detention center staff of failing to provide necessary medical care for his hereditary angioedema, a rare genetic condition that can cause severe swelling, pain and, if untreated, fatal complications.\n\nHanson had diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney issues, Powers said. She believes her dad died from medical neglect, adding there was a cellphone video circulating of her dad in the jail defecating himself and not getting help.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s super shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still unbelievable.\u201d\n\nPowers said she organized protests to raise awareness because the other inmate deaths haven\u2019t received answers or enough attention. She said she heard stories about issues at the jail but she \u201cdidn\u2019t realize it was such a huge problem until it happened to me.\u201d",
