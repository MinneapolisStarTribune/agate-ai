    "text": "Well into his 80s, Harry Lerner was still using his electric moped to scoot around Minneapolis, the city he loved and only occasionally left.\n\nLerner, 93, died April 8, surrounded by his family. He was born in north Minneapolis and spent his entire professional life within a one-mile radius of downtown \u2014 beginning with a job at a grocery/liquor store on Nicollet Island and ending at Lerner Publishing Group\u2019s headquarters at 1st and Washington Avenues N. He still drove there to work as recently as last month.\n\n\u201cHe knew this city. That area, especially, was such a big part of his life,\u201d said Harry\u2019s son Adam, CEO and publisher of Lerner, the largest independent publisher in a city whose literary footprint also includes numerous small presses.\n\nThe company grew from a book Harry wrote while he was in the Army in the 1950s, a guide to purchasing cars. When he returned home from Germany, where he was stationed, a trip to the doctor sparked a million-dollar idea.\n\n\u201cAfter he was discharged, he was in a doctor\u2019s office waiting room and he saw that kids were playing around, with nothing to keep them occupied, so he had the idea: \u2018I\u2019m going to publish books to sell to doctors\u2019 offices, to keep kids occupied.\u2019 It was really as simple as that,\u201c said Adam.\n\nHaving expanded significantly in the years since its 1959 founding, Lerner Publishing Group quietly became an \u201ceducation book juggernaut\u201a\u201d still specializing in literature for young people. Its hundreds of titles have won multiple awards, including Elana K. Arnold\u2019s 2017 National Book Award finalist for \u201cWhat Girls Are Made Of\u201d and a 2022 Caldecott Honor for \u201cUnspeakable: The Tulsa Race Massacre,\u201d by Carole Boston Weatherford and Floyd Cooper.\n\n\u201cMy dad had a big presence, charisma. I think he was in a way unstoppable,\u201d said Adam, who said his best advice from his father included simple things such as \u201ctaking people out to lunch is always a good investment,\u201d especially at favorites such as the Monte Carlo and Christos Greek Restaurant. \u201cWhen he wanted to do something, he never really backed down.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Harry, even in hospice care, remained eager to hear Adam\u2019s telephone updates from the Bologna Book Fair in Italy this month. And why, according to employees, Harry managed to make his workers feel like part of the Lerner family.\n\n\u201cHe was very committed to the people around him, to our employees, our books, our partners, our authors. Founders of companies, people say their personality becomes intertwined with their business and that was really the case with my dad,\u201d said Adam, who has two sons who now work at Lerner.\n\nHarry\u2019s personality \u2014 especially his infectious \u201cconfidence and optimism\u201d \u2014 will be his legacy at Lerner, said Adam.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the third generation working in the business now,\u201d said Adam, whose father was active in the DFL Party and devoted to his loved ones. \u201cIt\u2019s a family business. That will carry on. My dad set an amazing example.\u201d\n\nLerner is survived by his wife Sandy Davis; as well as his children, Adam (Maryann) Lerner, Mia (Raul) Posada, Danny (Sharon) Lerner and Leah (Itay) Ophir; and his grandchildren, Ariel and Leo Lerner, Ruthie, Nathan and Jesse Posada, and Gideon, Noam, Mika and Matan Ophir.",
