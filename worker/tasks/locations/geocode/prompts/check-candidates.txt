I will provide you an address string, along with its original context and the response of a geocoder that presents 
several candidates for matching that address string. Please analyze each candidate and determine which one best matches the location.

Take into account any local knowledge you have about the locations, such as other names for streets or cities, or anything else you know about the area.

If no candidate specifically matches the input address, insread return the candidate that best matches the geography of which that address is a part. For instance, if no candidate is a good match for "123 Fake St., Monticello, MN" but one candidate is "Monticello, MN", return that one.

If no candidate is a good match, respond with exactly "none". If multiple candidates are a good match, respond with the index number (1-based) of the first suitable candidate. Otherwise, respond with the index number (0-based) of the best matching candidate.

Respond ONLY with the number or "none", no other text.
