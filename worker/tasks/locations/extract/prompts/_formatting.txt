## CLASSIFICATION RULES:

### Type classification

Classify each location by the type of geography it represents. Valid types are:

* place: A named place. For example: "Target Headquarters" or "Roseville Mall"
* address: A street address, including a house number. This might include block numbers, such as "500 block of Portland Ave."
* intersection_road: An intersection of two non-highway roads, such as Main St. and 2nd St. Even if the story does not describe an intersection in a single string, you may infer it using other information in the article.
* intersection_highway: An intersection where one or both components is an interstate or highway, such as "I-94 and Selby Ave." or "Hwy. 20 and Hwy. 36"
* street_road: A street, road or highway without other geographic information or context. For example: "Hennepin Ave." or "I-35"
* span: A span of road between two points. For example: "I-35 between Pine City and Hinckley". Both a road and at least two reference points marking the beginning and end of a span must be present.
* neighborhood: Explicit mentions of neighborhood names
* region_city: A description of an area within a city that is not a named neighborhood, such as "South Minneapolis"
* city: The name of a city
* county: The name of a county in a state
* region_state: The name of a region or a general area being described within a state
* state: A state
* region_national: The name of a region or a general area being described within the United States
* country: A country
* other: Anything that doesn't fit into the categories above

## Importance classification

Classify each location by its importance to the events in the story, in accordance with the following labels and rules.

* primary: Locations at which the news event or news events described in the story took place. Locations that describe buildings, businesses or places that are the subjects of the story, or are relevant to the events of the story. Places that are directly affected by policies, legislation or issues that are central to the story.
* secondary: Locations that a person in the story is from, or is in some way related to. The locations of direct observations, interviews and descriptions used in the story. Places that are cited in studies, reports or other documents that are the subject of the story. Locations that are cited for context and are not directly relevant to the events or issues being described in the story.

## FORMATTING RULES:

* Return geocodable address strings in all cases where doing so is possible. For example, if a city is mentioned, like "Minnetonka" you should return "Minnetonka, MN" if it is clear from the story that Minnetonka, MN is the city being referenced. The same logic should be applied to places, addresses, intersections and other geographies. You may use the context of the story to fill out information that might not specifically be mentioned. States and countries can be presented on their own: "Minnesota" and not "Minnesota, MN" for example.

* Block numbers should be returned as addresses. For example, "200 block of Smith St." should be returned as "200 Smith St., Minneapolis, MN"

* Non-geocodable details (e.g., "eastbound lanes" or vague references like "metro" without a clear definition) should be omitted unless they are necessary for meaningful distinction.

* If a story describes the location of an incident in imprecise terms, such as happening "near" a town, but a precise place/landmark, intersection or location is not given, return only the name of the town. For instance "Highway 61 near Grand Marais" should just return "Grand Marais, MN"

* If a story includes a list of locations, like "Freeborn, Faribault, Blue Earth, Brown, Waseca, Nicollet, Le Sueur, Rock and Sibley counties all received snow," return each item in the list as a separate location (for instance, "Freeborn County, MN", "Faribault County, MN", etc.)

* Identifiable places and landmarks should be included with as much geographic information as can be inferred from the story. For instance, if a story mentions "Memorial Hospital," and later the context makes it clear that the hospital in question is located in "Minneapolis," return "Memorial Hospital, Minneapolis, MN". This also applies to places that are not proper nouns. A reference to something like "Monticello nuclear power plant" should be returned as "Nuclear power plant, Monticello, MN."

Return the paragraph from which the location was extracted and return it as "original_text." Ensure these are copied verbatim from the story.

Return a brief description, no more than 50 words, of the nature of the location and its importance in the story under a "description" attribute.
