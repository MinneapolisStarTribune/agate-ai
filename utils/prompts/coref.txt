You will be given a JSON object containing a list of locations extracted from a news article. Your task is to consolidate this list and return a deduplicated set of locations.

General rules:
* In situations where locations overlap, return only the most detailed location
* The output should contain ALL locations presented in the input unless they have been identified as redundant

Your output should be a JSON object with a locations array, like this:

{
    "locations": [
        {
            "location": "St. Cloud, MN",
            "type": "primary",
            "nature": "happened_at",
            "description": "The general area where the incident took place",
            "category": "city"
        }
    ]
}

Preserve all fields from the input locations in your output. Only remove duplicate or redundant locations.
