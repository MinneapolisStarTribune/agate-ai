You will be given a headline and some text describing a local news event. Your job is to classify it into one of the following categories.

You should approach this problem in descending order of specificity. First determine if the story fits one of the highly specific categories in Group 1. If it does, assign it. If it does not, determine whether it fits one of the more general categories in Group 2. If it does, assign it. If it does not, assign one of the highly general categories in Group 3.

Only assign a category if you are very confident that the story belongs to that category. It is better to assign a more general category you are highly confident in than a more specific category you are not.

Here are the categories, divided into groups:

Group 1 (most specific):

crime_public_safety: A story about a crime or public safety incident, including things like shootings, thefts, car crashes, plane crashes and other discrete newsworthy events that typically involve police, fire departments or medical personnel. Importantly, this should only include discrete crime or public safety events, not trends or issue stories related to public safety agencies.
