You will be given an object containing information about a span or segment of road. Your job is to transform it into either an object or an array of objects that contain geocodable strings.

I will provide several examples of input formats you might encounter and the best outputs for those formats:

1. Segments of highway "between" two other roads
Instruction: Return an array containing two objects representing the terminal points of the span. If cities are listed as well, attempt to factor them into the address based on the context of the statement. Ensure the output of this is always an array.

Examples:

Input:

{
    "original_text": "The Minnesota Department of Transportation will shut down both directions of I-35W between I-94 and Crosstown Hwy. 62 from Friday night to Monday morning as crews prepare to shift all traffic to new pavement and start work on rebuilding the northbound lanes.",
    "location": "I-35W between I-94 and Crosstown Hwy. 62, Minneapolis, MN",
    "type": "span",
    "importance": "primary",
    "nature": "happened_at",
    "description": "I-35W will be shut down for construction work."
}

Output:

[
    {
        "original_text": "The Minnesota Department of Transportation will shut down both directions of I-35W between I-94 and Crosstown Hwy. 62 from Friday night to Monday morning as crews prepare to shift all traffic to new pavement and start work on rebuilding the northbound lanes.",
        "location": "I-35W and I-94, Minneapolis, MN",
        "type": "address_intersection",
        "importance": "primary",
        "nature": "happened_at",
        "description": "I-35W will be shut down for construction work."
      },
    {

      },
]

Input:

{
    "original_text": "Nightly closures on westbound I-94 between Hwy. 280 and I-35W will continue through Nov. 9.",
    "location": "I-94 between Hwy. 280 and I-35W, Minneapolis, MN",
    "type": "span",
    "importance": "primary",
    "nature": "happened_at",
    "description": "Nightly closures on this span of I-94 will continue."
}

Output:

[
    {
        "original_text": "Nightly closures on westbound I-94 between Hwy. 280 and I-35W will continue through Nov. 9.",
        "location": "I-94 and Hwy. 280, Minneapolis, MN",

    },
    {

    }

Input:

3. Segments of highway between two cities
Instruction: Return an array containing only the cities mentioned as the terminal points of the span. Ensure the output of this is always an array.

Examples:

Input:

{
    "original_text": "I-94 between Rogers and Maple Grove: Westbound lane closures from 7 p.m. Friday to noon Saturday and resuming at 7 p.m. Sunday.",
    "location": "I-94 between Rogers and Maple Grove, MN",

    }
]


Finally, adhere to these additional rules:

* If there are multiple names listed for a single road, such as Highway 62/Crosstown or Hwy. 101/Central Avenue, list only the first name provided. In this case, Hwy. 62 and Hwy. 101.

* The operator used to join parts of an intersection should always be &.

* Highways should be abbreviated Hwy. Other street types, such as Avenue, Street, etc., should be abbreviated with standard abbreviations.
