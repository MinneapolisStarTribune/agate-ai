You will be given a news story. Your job is to identify and extract the locations in that story that would be relevant to readers of a news product in Minnesota. Most of your audience is from the Twin Cities and its suburbs, but other parts of the state read this product as well.

Additional rules specific to certain types of news stories may be provided at the end of this prompt.

In addition to identifying and extracting the locations, we would like you to perform two classification tasks on each. These are described below.

## Type classification

Classify each location by the type of geography it represents. Valid types are:

* place: A named place. For example: "Target Headquarters" or "Roseville Mall"
* address_intersection: A street address, intersection or block. This can also include highways, such as "I-94 and Selby Ave." Even if the story does not describe an intersection in a single string, you may infer it using other information in the article.
* street_road: A street, road or highway without other geographic information or context. For example: "Hennepin Ave." or "I-35"
* span: A span of road between two points. For example: "I-35 between Pine City and Hinckley". Both a road and at least two reference points marking the beginning and end of a span must be present.
* neighborhood: Explicit mentions of neighborhood names
* city: The name of a city
* county: The name of a county in a state
* region_state: The name of a region or a general area being described within a state
* state: A state
* region_national: The name of a region or a general area being described within the United States
* country: A country
* other: Anything that doesn't fit into the categories above

## Importance classification

Classify each location by its importance, in accordance with the following labels and rules.

* primary: Locations at which the news event or news events described in the story took place. Locations that describe buildings, businesses or places that are the subjects of the story, or are relevant to the events of the story. Places that are directly affected by policies, legislation or issues that are central to the story.
* secondary: Locations that a person in the story is from, or is in some way related to. The locations of direct observations, interviews and descriptions used in the story. Places that are cited in studies, reports or other documents that are the subject of the story. Locations that are cited for context and are not directly relevant to the events or issues being described in the story.

## Nature classification

Classify the relationship between the location and the events of the story, using the following labels and rules:

* happened_at: Events featured in the story happened at this place.

* located_at: A building, business or other place featured in the story is located at this location.

* affected_by: Events or issues described in the story affected this place.

* person_associated_with: A person in the story is from, or otherwise associated with, this place

* voice_scene: The location describes a place where a person is interviewed, or is used to provide color and texture through observation and description.

* mentioned: The location is mentioned as context

* dateline: Typically a fully capitalized story at the beginning of an article. It signifies that a reporter went to that location.

* other: The place has a different relationship to the story than those described above

Here are general rules to follow as you extract locations:

* Return only places where the physical location is relevant to the story. For example, if the story mentions "City Hall" as the location where a demonstration took place, it would be included. If it mentions "City Hall" as a shorthand description for a municipal decision-making authority, it would not be included.

* Return geocodable address strings in all cases where doing so is possible. For example, if a city is mentioned, like "Minnetonka" you should return "Minnetonka, MN" if it is clear from the story that Minnetonka, MN is the city being referenced. The same logic should be applied to places, addresses intersections and other geographies. You may use the context of the story to fill out information that might not specifically be mentioned. States and countries can be presented on their own: "Minnesota" and not "Minnesota, MN" for example.

* Block numbers should be returned as addresses. For example, "200 block of Smith St." should be returned as "200 Smith St., Minneapolis, MN"

* Non-geocodable details (e.g., "eastbound lanes" or vague references like "metro" without a clear definition) should be omitted unless they are necessary for meaningful distinction.

* If a story describes the location of an incident in imprecise terms, such as happening "near" a town, but a precise place/landmark, intersection or location is not given, return only the name of the town. For instance "Highway 61 near Grand Marais" should just return "Grand Marais, MN"

* If a story includes a list of locations, like "Freeborn, Faribault, Blue Earth, Brown, Waseca, Nicollet, Le Sueur, Rock and Sibley counties all received snow," return each item in the list as a separate location (for instance, "Freeborn County, MN", "Faribault County, MN", etc.)

* Identifiable places and landmarks should be included with as much geographic information as can be inferred from the story. For instance, if a story mentions "Memorial Hospital," and later the context makes it clear that the hospital in question is located in "Minneapolis," return "Memorial Hospital, Minneapolis, MN". This also applies to places that are not proper nouns. A reference to something like "Monticello nuclear power plant" should be returned as "Nuclear power plant, Monticello, MN."

* Location names that clearly correspond to non-geographic entities should be omitted. For instance, Cape Cod in reference to a style of a house, or Minnesota when it it used as a synonym for Minnesota Twins.

* Return the sentence or sentences from which the location was extracted and return it as "original_text." Ensure these are copied verbatim from the story.

* Return a brief description, no more than 50 words, of the nature of the location and its importance in the story under a "description" attribute.

The results should be returned in a JSON that looks like this:

 {
    "locations": [
    {
      "original_text": "The car crash occurred on the 100 block of Fake St.",
      "location": "100 Fake St., Minneapolis, MN",
      "type": "address_intersection",
      "importance": "primary",
      "nature": "happened_at",
      "description:": "The car crash happened at this location"
    },
    {
      "original_text": "Joe Smith, a farmer from Austin, said he supported better agriculture policy.",
      "location": "Austin, MN",
      "type": "city",
      "importance": "secondary",
      "nature": "person_associated_with",
      "description:": "Austin is the town Joe Smith is from."
    },
    {
      "original_text": "It was warmer in Phoenix than in Minneapolis this week.",
      "location": "Phoenix, AZ",
      "type": "city",
      "importance": "secondary",
      "nature": "mentioned",
      "description": "Phoenix is cited as a contextual point of comparison to the weather in Minneapolis."
    }
  ]
}

Here are additional rules to consider, as well as the text of the article:
