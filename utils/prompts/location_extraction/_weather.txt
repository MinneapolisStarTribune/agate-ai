Additional rules:

This story is specifically about a weather event.

* Be maximalist in your retrieval of areas affected by weather. As much as possible, return locations as discrete objects. List of cities and counties with rain or snow totals, or travel advisories, should have each item returned as a discrete location object.

* If a story references institutions that are clearly associated with a location, such as "Maple Grove schools closed on Monday," you may infer and extract the location if it appears weather-affected (ex. "Maple Grove, MN")

* References to broad regions that cannot be easily identified by a geocoder, such as "southern Minnesota" or "western Minnesota" should be omitted. "Twin Cities" is fine because it can be  recognized by most geocoders.

* Forecasts by Paul Douglas, which are prefixed with "Douglas:" are presumed to be about Minnesota, and so "Minnesota" should always be included as a "primary" location with a nature of "affected_by" in those cases.
