Martinez Castillo Lloyd was found guilty in a bench trial in Ramsey County District Court in connection with the wounding on March 29 of Damarjae Lott in an apartment in the 800 block of Pierce Butler Route. Presiding Judge John Guthmann will sentence Lloyd on Nov. 6 on two counts: possessing a gun despite being a felon and a gross misdemeanor count of failing to store a gun out of the reach of a child. Lloyd’s felony drug conviction in 2010 made him ineligible to possess a gun. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Police Chief Axel Henry said in a statement, “If you’re not supposed to have guns, don’t have guns. If you have guns, you have a duty and a responsibility to keep them safe and away from those who shouldn’t have them.” According to the charges and the judge’s verdict filing: Officers arrived at the apartment shortly before 9 p.m. and found Damarjae on the floor at the top of the stairs with a gunshot wound to the back of his head. Medics took him to a hospital for surgery. Several children in the apartment said the girl was playing with a gun while visiting her cousins, then shot Damarjae and fled to her home on Charles Avenue. “I accidentally shot somebody,” the complaint quoted her as telling the officers as they took her into custody that night. “I didn’t know the gun was loaded.” Lloyd is the father of two of the children, who live somewhere else and were visiting him. His two children and five others, ranging in age from 10 to 13, arrived about 8:20 p.m. Lloyd left for the store with a friend about 8:50 p.m. and came back minutes after the shooting. While Lloyd was gone, his son and his niece went into Lloyd’s bedroom. They each retrieved a handgun and started waving it around. The two told police they have played with the guns “a dozen times” in the past year when Lloyd is not around, and “the firearms are generally unloaded.” The niece said she last played with one of the guns the previous weekend, and she assumed the guns were unloaded as usual. As she was waving and playing with the gun, a shot was fired that hit Damarjae. After his arrest, Lloyd said he keeps the guns high up in a cabinet and usually stored them unloaded. He acknowledged that his children and his niece have seen him handle the guns previously. There was no gun safe or “other form of locked cabinet” in the cabinet for storing firearms.",

        "input": "Headline: What a heart doctor says after 27-year-old runner collapses at Minneapolis half marathon and dies\nText: Little has been disclosed about the death of a 27-year-old man after his collapse Sunday in the home stretch of a Minneapolis half marathon. The family of Blake Groulx did say in his online obituary that he was stricken with “cardiac issues” when he fell to the pavement and hit his head around the 11-mile mark of the City of Lakes Half Marathon that encircled Lake Harriet and Bde Maka Ska. The obituary also noted that Groulx enjoyed running among an array of physical activities including hiking, camping, tennis and pickleball. Two of the several health care professionals also participating who rushed to Groulx’s aid said he appeared fit enough to to complete the 13.1-mile course. Groulx died later Sunday at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis, where a doctor signed his death certificate. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office said no autopsy has been planned, and messages have yet to be returned by Groulx’s family for further information for this story. Dr. Michelle Carlson, director of Hennepin Health Care’s Cardiology Division, played no role in the Minneapolis man’s care following his collapse, but she answered in writing some questions about this type of case. How is it that a seemingly healthy and fit person in their mid-20s can be stricken with a fatal cardiac event? There are many possible causes for sudden cardiac death with exertion. One possibility is a genetic cardiac problem ... that causes an arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation). Other possibilities are an infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or a congenital anomaly of the coronary arteries. Both of these could again lead to an arrhythmia. How prevalent is it that a case like this happens, if not in numerical terms, can it be considered very rare, rare, etc.? It is very rare. Among competitive athletes in the U.S., the rate of sudden cardiac death with exercise is probably less than 5/100,000. Does the risk of such an event increase in prevalence based on undertaking a particularly strenuous activity? Strenuous activity doesn’t increase the risk of sudden cardiac death unless the individual in question has an underlying cardiac problem. Could there be medications being taken that would increase the risk of such an event? There is some data that some medications might increase the risk of sudden cardiac death with exertion. These include medications typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. nortriptyline) and some antiepileptics. Is heredity a potential factor? Yes, many of the possible causes of sudden cardiac death with exercise are genetic or inherited. Other than the obvious — watch your weight and diet, and get exercise — what else can people do to improve heart health? If someone in your family has had heart trouble (especially at a young age), talk to your doctor.",

        "input": "Headline: Speeding motorists turn Minneapolis avenues into urban speedway\nText: A street racer in the wee hours along the 3300 block of Park Avenue in south Minneapolis last month veered off course and plowed through three front yards before flipping and coming to rest near the porch of Mark Schoening’s meticulously restored Victorian home. “It was a sound unlike anything I’ve ever heard; it was like a massive bomb,” Schoening later recalled. His porch was left in ruins and front yard littered with car parts and coated in gasoline: “Thank God it didn’t ignite.” For residents of the city’s Central neighborhood, street racing, crashes and speeding have turned Park and Portland avenues into urban freeways, casting an air of anxiety over the neighborhood. Many say they avoid walking on sidewalks, crossing the street and parking in front of their homes for fear of out-of-control motorists. Both one-way streets feature two lanes and an unprotected bike lane between Lake and 46th streets that often becomes a de facto third lane for speedsters despite a posted speed limit of 30 mph. “It’s just constant,” said Jeff White, who has lived on the 3300 block of Park Avenue for 17 years. “It’s insane.” Both streets are under the purview of Hennepin County, which plans a $38 million roadway improvement project between Interstate 94 and 46th Street beginning next year. The idea is to make biking, walking and crossing both streets safer, and to deploy “design elements to calm vehicle travel speeds.” It’s unclear at this point what those elements might entail. But county spokesperson Carolyn Marinan said: “We are hearing the concerns of the community and taking them into account as we move forward with the proposed project.” Hennepin County Commissioner Angela Conley not only represents the Central neighborhood, she lives on Oakland Avenue, which is sandwiched between Portland and Park avenues. She’s grown accustomed to “the squeal of tires and the sickening thud of metal” signaling yet another crash. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS), there were 65 crashes from Lake Street to 46th Street along Portland and Park in 2022, the most recent data available. Comparable data from recent prior years isn’t available, and 2023 statistics haven’t been released yet. “It’s extraordinarily dangerous,” Conley said. “I can’t wrap my head around why we still have roads like this in residential communities.” Once a grand boulevard stretching south from downtown Minneapolis, Park Avenue was converted from a two-way street to a one-way mini-freeway in the late 1940s to accommodate suburban commuters before Interstate 35W opened a decade later. The evolution of Portland Avenue’s design is less clear. Arrow-straight, multi-lane, one-way streets where drivers don’t have to fret about head-on crashes tend to encourage “risk-taking behavior,” said Nichole Morris, a research associate professor in the University of Minnesota’s Department of Mechanical Engineering. “The road becomes a playground if there are fewer obstructions to worry about,” she said, noting their barren nature can also erode communities because people don’t feel safe walking or biking. Morris, who isn’t associated with the county’s redevelopment project, said there are a number of design elements that can be deployed to slow traffic on busy thoroughfares. One is converting a street to two-way traffic, which is the case on Portland and Park avenues south of 46th Street. Another involves median strips and pedestrian islands, which “can be calming and create a feeling of community in the area.” Morris said “chicanes” — gentle curves in the roadway to slow traffic — can help, as well. This was deployed along Snelling Avenue in St. Paul near Highland Park. “It forces you to slow down because people must navigate a more complex roadway,” she said. For its part, Minneapolis is making improvements to city streets near Portland and Park avenues to bolster safety, spokesperson Allen Henry said. That includes safety measures at 34th Street to provide better connections to Green Central Elementary School, plus a planned reconstruction of 35th and 36th streets will begin next year. The city has found that narrowing streets using protected bike lanes and medians can encourage people to drive at safer speeds, Henry said. This has been done on Plymouth Avenue N., Emerson and Fremont avenues N., and 2nd Street in the Mill District. Still, Morris notes some traffic-calming measures “are not easy to install and they’re expensive.” She said they also prompt questions about maintenance and snow plowing, always a concern in Minnesota’s climate. “These are tough decisions,” she said, but “they can be very impactful.” In Conley’s view, redeveloping Portland and Park avenues is also an equity issue. She points to Blaisdell Avenue, a city street on the west side of I-35W that features median strips with perennials and small trees, and a protected bike lane, as a model for her neighborhood. “Southwest Minneapolis looks a whole lot different demographically than south Minneapolis,” she said. “When you see how different the roads are, it’s telling. You can visually see that the things we should have in a denser, browner part of the community, we don’t have. But the investment has been made in wealthier, whiter part of the community.” Marinan said engineering solutions, such as median strips and protected bike lanes, “are just one tool. Road design can help reduce speeds, but engineering alone is not going to solve these challenges, particularly involving street racing.” On that note, she added that “education and enforcement is important and drivers are responsible for their behavior. Speeding and erratic driving are controlled by the person behind the wheel.” In Schoening’s case, the driver of the 2024 Ford Mustang that crashed into his house was a 24-year-old man from Lakeville who was legally drunk. He said the driver’s iPhone was retrieved not far from the car, presumably recording the street race. Ironically, the phone noted, “It looks like you’ve been in a crash,” with a time-stamp of 4:45 a.m. The crash caused more than $30,000 in damage to his home. Street racing in the neighborhood got worse during the pandemic, said Anna Ashcroft, who lives on Park Avenue near 36th Street, a phenomenon seen throughout the Twin Cities. Living on an urban speedway alters the “normal passages of childhood,” she said, like taking her children out for a walk or teaching them how to ride a bicycle. “It seems out of reach,” she said. “How do I teach them to be safe?” Shortly after speaking with the Star Tribune, Ashcroft texted and said there had been yet another accident near her home. The same thing happened after Conley’s interview last month. She sent along video of a chaotic crash scene. “A constant occurrence,” she wrote. Data journalist Jeff Hargarten contributed to this story.",

The Yellow Medicine County Sheriff’s Office was called for a welfare check at a house near Clarkfield, south of Montevideo, on Saturday afternoon, the agency said in a news release. When officers arrived, the man they meant to check on fled into a farm field with a rifle, the release said. Sheriff’s deputies rushed neighbors out of the house next to the field and said the man pointed his rifle at them before running into the just-vacated house. Deputies surrounded the house and tried to talk to the man but called a SWAT team when they could not persuade him to come outside. Members of the Kandiyohi-Meeker-Willmar SWAT team arrived and also tried to talk the person out of the house. The man fired at the SWAT team, according to the Sheriff’s Office. A SWAT team member shot back, hitting the man in the leg, but the standoff continued. Two other SWAT teams relieved the Kandiyohi-Meeker-Willmar group after about eight hours, according to the Sheriff’s Office. Just after 6 a.m. Sunday, the man left the house and shot a long gun at the SWAT teams. Another SWAT team member shot back and hit the man.

According to the criminal complaint, Nathan Mellstrom Matz fired numerous shots with an AK-47 rifle sometime before 4:30 a.m. Saturday at the apartment building, in the 4000 block of Minnehaha Avenue in the Longfellow community. Several 911 calls summoned the police, who evacuated residents before finding Matz in a stairwell holding the rifle. An officer gave Matz a minute and 20 seconds to drop the gun before firing a single shot at him. The suspect was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he was expected to survive his wound. No one else was injured in the episode. One resident told police he heard gunfire, stepped out in the hall and ran back into his apartment when he saw the gunman down the hall, who fired and nearly hit him. Another resident said he heard gunshots through his floor and found bullet holes there. A homeowner across the street said her house was hit by bullets and that she believed it was targeted during the shooting. Matz is charged with three counts of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon, but prosecutors may seek an aggravated sentence because, among other things, the shooting occurred in a densely populated area.",

        "input": "Headline: Why isn’t medication that eliminates opioid cravings more widely used?\nText: For William Cope Moyers, a vice president at Minnesota’s Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation treatment organization, Suboxone was “a magic bullet.” After struggling for three years to get off prescription opioids, Moyers was given the medication in 2013 to ease his cravings for painkillers. It worked quickly and completely. “I was like, “Oh, OK, I’m done, yeah,” he said. Moyers credits the procedures he’d learned in a 12-step program as equally important in getting off opioids, but Suboxone “allowed me to clear my head, literally and figuratively.” So it might be surprising that in the recovery community, the use of Suboxone can be controversial. “Some people believe recovery should not include mood- or mind-altering chemicals,” said Dr. David Frenz, a Minneapolis-based addiction specialist who prescribed Moyers’ Suboxone. “There is a lot of stigma around the use of anti-craving medication,” Moyers said. Even though he was a longtime Hazelden leader, public speaker and author of books on addiction and recovery, “there was some wariness about me once I revealed that I had taken the Suboxone,” he said. “I had peers, I had colleagues, who didn’t quite trust me anymore. In fact, I had one who said that I should not be speaking for the organization until I had a year of sobriety again.” He recalled talking to treatment specialists who said “they don’t use Suboxone with their patients because it’s a crutch,” Moyers said. “I’m like, ‘Wow. It’s FDA-approved.’ I did a webinar the other day and there was a lot of positive reception to my story, but there were some people — including one woman I know very, very well — who said, ‘I don’t care if it’s FDA-approved or not. There’s no room for mood- and mind-altering drugs in recovery.’” Suboxone contains an opioid called buprenorphine. But it acts differently than opioid pain medications do, Frenz said. In addition to ending cravings, it eases withdrawal. And it doesn’t create a “high” — on the contrary, Frenz said, it eliminates the euphoria that many people feel after taking painkillers. “So if somebody does slip, it prevents the opioid from doing anything,” he said. Addiction recovery has become especially urgent in recent years because an influx of illegal fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, is causing overdoses to skyrocket. In Minnesota, deadly overdoses have almost tripled, from 342 in 2019 to more than a thousand in 2022. Fentanyl, which can be deadly in tiny amounts, frequently is added to street drugs like heroin, even non-opioid drugs like Xanax or Adderall, without users being aware of its presence. “You could certainly die of an overdose earlier in my career, but it was harder,” Frenz said. “The margin for error with fentanyl is zero. Even if you’re a savvy user.” Moyers never turned to illegal opioids because he was able to keep getting prescriptions. But prescription painkillers are generally tightly controlled, so addicts may turn to heroin or other opioids they can more easily obtain on the black market. “Do not take any pill unless it came from a pharmacy in a bottle with your name on it,” Frenz stressed. For anyone who might ignore that warning, Frenz urged using fentanyl test strips on drugs they plan to take and keeping a supply of Narcan (generic name naloxone), an over-the-counter nasal-spray medication that can reverse an overdose. Frenz also advised never using when you are alone, using only clean needles and syringes and not hesitating to dial 911. In Minnesota, he said, “Steve’s Law,” or the “Good Samaritan Law,” provides some legal protections for the person who calls 911.",

        "input": "Headline: Minnesota Medicaid fraud investigators examining more autism service providers\nText: Minnesota regulators are investigating a growing number of autism service providers for Medicaid fraud, and looking into additional oversight measures in the fast-growing field. The Department of Human Services has active investigations into 29 individuals or agencies providing early intervention services, nearly twice the number of investigations it was conducting into such providers a couple months ago. The Minnesota Reformer reported the FBI was looking into fraud in the program this summer. DHS told The Minnesota Star Tribune in July that it had 15 active investigations into autism service providers and 10 closed investigations. The department sent a letter this week to Minnesota House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring,  noting the increased number of investigations and providing some information on the 10 closed cases. Demuth had requested additional details on the fraud investigations in July. “I was surprised at the high number. I think 29 active investigations is huge,” Demuth said, adding that she is glad state investigators are digging into potential fraud. “The fact that the number of investigations have increased quickly is a good sign, but yet how many more are out there?” The Medicaid-funded Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention (EIDBI) benefit helps people younger than 21 who have autism spectrum disorder or related conditions. The benefit can cover a range of services, from evaluation and treatment planning to intervention services, family training and counseling. The number of young people receiving those services and providers doing the early intervention work has grown rapidly since Minnesotans started using the benefit in earnest in 2018. Early supports for kids with autism are critical and there is a high demand for the services, families of children with autism and experts in the field have said. DHS staff did not comment Wednesday on what is driving the increased number of investigations into such providers or whether there are trends in the cases the agency is examining. “DHS takes seriously our role in promoting the health, safety and well-being of children and vulnerable adults, and our obligation as a steward of a significant amount of public dollars. The Office of Inspector General continues to review tips, referrals and data to identify the need for investigations,” department officials said in a statement. In the letter to Demuth, DHS Inspector General Kulani Moti said there are nearly 300 agencies doing the early autism intervention work that are enrolled in Minnesota Health Care Programs. The agency does screening site visits when a provider is enrolling in the health care programs, Moti noted, and providers have to fill out an assurance statement attesting that they have certain experience and training. Individuals in contact with kids and families also have to pass a background check. The state does a revalidation screening process for the autism service providers every five years. Moti outlined two potential next steps that could bring additional oversight: Licensing service providers and clarifying whether DHS should be required to review the employment status of providers. The agency has been consulting with people in the autism community on whether the state should license early intervention providers and is going to give lawmakers recommendations on that issue in the upcoming legislative session, the letter said. “We look forward to working with you in the upcoming legislative session to strengthen the oversight of EIDBI,” Moti wrote. The letter also listed the outcomes in the 10 closed investigations into autism intervention providers from the past five years. In the most recent cases, both closed this January, the state recovered more than $86,000 from Northstar Therapy Services in Edina, and recovered $192,000 and leveled a $5,000 fine on St. Paul-based Senzilla Health Services Inc. The list also includes an investigation into Sharmarke Issa that was closed in June 2023 and resulted in the provider being “terminated” from receiving Medicaid payments. Issa, the former board chair of the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority, pleaded guilty to wire fraud Wednesday in federal court in connection with the Feeding Our Future scheme, which centered around federal meal programs for low-income children. The 29 ongoing investigations into autism service providers are just a fraction of the 565 open investigations within DHS’s Medicaid Provider Audits and Investigations unit. That unit looks into issues with billing and services by providers who are paid through Medical Assistance, Minnesota’s Medicaid program.",

Unite Here Local 17 filed a complaint on Monday against both the Vestalia Hospitality group and the former Korean-American restaurant in Minneapolis’ Uptown neighborhood, run by award-winning chef Ann Kim. The allegations range from union-busting efforts to refusal to give the union a chance to bargain over the closure of the restaurant last month, said Sheigh Freeberg, secretary-treasurer of Local 17. “We want Ann Kim and Vestalia to be held accountable for their actions,” said Freeberg. “And we also want the entire restaurant industry in Minneapolis to know that they have to respect their workers if they choose to organize.” Kim’s closed at the end of August, citing “ongoing financial losses.” The union requested proof of the financial losses, Freeberg said, but the business never provided it as required. The union was also never included in bargaining discussions about the closure, Freeberg said. Kim and representatives for Vestalia did not respond to requests for comment. The union released a statement on Monday about the the eight charges it filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The charges follow the restaurant’s turbulent history and financial struggles, starting with the closure of Ann Kim’s previous restaurant at the same location, Sooki and Mimi. A few weeks after that first restaurant closed in October 2023, Kim’s opened and received rave reviews, with lines out the door. But some employees voiced complaints about feeling disrespected and working unstable hours. They also expressed concerns about the restaurant’s decision to use a service charge instead of standard tipping. A group of workers in June announced their intention to organize. Shortly afterwards, someone vandalized Kim’s and threw a concrete slab and paint through a window. Kim voiced her opposition to the unionizing effort days later, saying her staff “can come together as a Kim’s team without a union.” The workers voted 65% in favor of forming a union after Kim and Vestalia said they would not recognize it voluntarily. Two months later, Kim’s announced it would close at the end of August. Two lawyers who specialize in labor and employment issues said the union appears to have a case if it turns out that the business didn’t include the union in discussions about the impacts of shutting down. “If the employer did basically close up shop and didn’t provide any notice or information to the union, that could be a very troublesome fact for the employer,” said Mark Nelson, a Denver-based attorney who handles employment cases nationwide. Charlotte Garden, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, said union negotiations on the impact of a closure, also known as “effects bargaining,” are typically required. That can include bargaining for severance payout and lining up jobs for workers at other company branches. Garden added that union negotiations are required regardless of the reason for the closure. “Whether the closure was for economic reasons or anti-union reasons, the effects bargaining is still required,” she said. Garden said that even in a situation where the union had not finalized a contract with Vestalia and Kim’s, companies are still required to bargain with the union. The National Labor Relations Board now will determine if the union’s claims are legitimate. If the board agrees that the restaurant broke federal worker laws, there could be financial penalties. Nelson said that although he could see an argument for Kim’s that they needed to close because of vandalism and financial struggles, he suspects it will be an “uphill battle” for the restaurant based on what he’s read.",

        "input": "Headline: Homeless medical respite facility advances over Uptown business objections\nText: Lakeshore Care, a company created earlier this year, has received a key city approval to establish a 24-bed medical respite center for homeless people in Minneapolis’ Uptown business district despite the vociferous protestations of neighboring business owners. The embattled project, proposed for 918 W. Lake St., has received overwhelmingly negative public comments through two separate attempts to obtain city permits in recent months. Lakeshore Care applied first for a conditional use permit through the Planning Commission in June, with discussions delayed numerous times as community members complained about a lack of engagement. In response, city staff suggested Lakeshore Care submit a new application for an interim use permit, which would allow the center to operate for a trial period of up to five years. Medical respite is a service for homeless people with acute health problems who have been released from the hospital but are still too sick to be on the streets. The city’s zoning code categorizes medical respite facilities as emergency overnight homeless shelters, but they are not. Lakeshore Care proposes to only accept clients discharged with doctor’s orders for stays up to 60 days. The Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan allows “emergency shelters” as a conditional use in all zones of the city including the Uptown commercial district. Still, some Uptown business owners testified at a public hearing before City Council members earlier this month that services should be relegated to industrial zones rather than business districts because the presence of homeless people makes their customers uncomfortable. Others raised concerns about Lakeshore Care being an untested for-profit company, and whether it will be able to provide healing in small, windowless living quarters without outdoor green space. Business owners who spoke against the facility have received one-star online reviews. In the days after a fire destroyed an apartment building immediately across from 918 W. Lake St., displacing tenants and shutting down a day spa whose owner had been critical of Lakeshore Care, panic spread among business owners who suspected the arson had been retaliatory as well. Police eventually arrested a homeless man, but the charges established no connection between his alleged motives and the debate raging over Lakeshore Care’s permitting. Brenna Wernersbach, owner of MoonStone MPLS gift shop, said they have not appreciated how the public vetting of Lakeshore Care has devolved into an entrenched fight between people who don’t want homeless people around and advocates who find that position immoral. Wernersbach believes there are legitimate, unanswered questions about the provider. “They say they have the experience, but they don’t elaborate,” Wernersbach said. “On the one hand, this is a safe and serene environment with proximity to medical centers, and that’s why they want to put it here, but then they’ll turn around and say it’s not even safe enough to have windows.” Established nonprofits that have provided medical respite beds in the Twin Cities for years include the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities and Union Gospel Mission. Lakeshore Care declined multiple interview requests from the Star Tribune. Operations manager Zakaria Suleman said in an email that the center’s medical director does not want to be identified, but that Lakeshore’s “team is well-versed in supporting patients with diverse backgrounds and needs.” In a City Council committee meeting on Sept. 10, Suleman and Lakeshore Care owner Ali Warsame said they plan to hire mental health counselors, substance abuse specialists and 24-hour security guards. They said the facility would have an interior and exterior surveillance system, and “strict” anti-loitering and curfew policies. “This facility will provide a safe and supportive space where individuals can regain their health, access critical follow-up care, and receive the necessary support to transition back into the community,” Suleman said at the meeting. Lakeshore Care has attended meetings with nearby neighborhood associations that were arranged by Council Member Aisha Chughtai’s office. Council Member Michael Rainville suggested the licensing committee postpone its vote until Lakeshore Care could also engage the Uptown business community. On Sept. 18 Lakeshore Care invited a few business owners to a private Zoom meeting on the following day. Many business owners could not get time off on such short notice, but passed around the link so others who were not invited could attend. “There’s been a lot of concerns with how this meeting was scheduled on short notice, why it is only virtual and not on-site, why it is not open to the public, and why it cannot be rescheduled for a time before the decision on the 24th,” wrote State Farm agent Lawrence Thomas to city staff in an email shared with the Star Tribune. “I hope this helps illustrate some of the concerns so many of my neighbors have here in Uptown.” On Tuesday the business and licensing committee approved Lakeshore Care’s application after the owner agreed to install skylights, staff one security guard for every eight patients and appoint a community liaison officer to maintain communication with neighboring residents and businesses The facility still requires full City Council approval and state licenses. The state Department of Human Services’ enrollment process for new recuperative care operators is currently paused due to “systems work related to claims processing,” said spokesman Scott Peterson. He said DHS estimates enrollment will reopen in a couple of months. Lakeshore Care’s application materials say the facility aims to open in January.",

        "input": "Headline: Republicans hoping to win in Minnesota focus on state Legislature\nText: For hours every afternoon, Wayne Johnson crisscrosses subdivision streets, knocking on doors and ringing doorbells, leaving leaflets in screen door handles and sometimes giving his pitch to voters. Johnson, a Republican running for the Legislature in a hotly contested open seat in the east metro against DFLer Lucia Wroblewski, is largely working on his own around Lake Elmo and Afton. He’s relying on a list of voters supplied by the state Republican Party with no army of volunteers, just one other person, and putting a lot of miles on his slip-on Skechers shoes. He says he tries to engage with everyone, without regard for party affiliation. “I talk to everybody,” he said. “Let’s have a conversation.” For Republicans and the groups supporting them, a bout of early-summer optimism about flipping the state for former President Donald Trump has narrowed to the ambition of winning back the state House of Representatives by flipping a few districts. Yet Minnesota Republican Party State Chair David Hann insists the Trump campaign has not given up on the state. “The Trump campaign has been very interested in Minnesota,” Hann said. “They have been heavily engaged and continue to be so. They believe it’s a winnable race, I believe it is too.” Others aren’t so sure the Trump campaign is still engaged. “The national campaign can tend to be focused more on other states than Minnesota,” said Jake Coleman, senior adviser of Americans for Prosperity Action in Minnesota, a libertarian-leaning group that does not coordinate with candidates. Only a few months ago, Republicans were optimistic about their chances in Minnesota, even before President Joe Biden’s poor debate performance. Despite a major cash advantage for the Minnesota DFL over the Minnesota Republican Party, there were exploitable fractures. An unpopular incumbent wasn’t too exciting for Democrats. Some progressives were demoralized by his support for Israel’s war in Gaza, and almost 46,000 Democrats cast “uncommitted” primary ballots in protest. More than 22,000 others voted for Rep. Dean Phillips or self-help author Marianne Williamson. The Trump campaign signaled seriousness about Minnesota when James Blair, the campaign’s political director, wrote in a memo in June that it would open eight offices in the state in July. By the end of the summer, the Trump campaign claimed 13 offices in Minnesota. But most of those are Republican county or congressional offices doing double-duty as Trump campaign offices, some with just a small Trump sign or two in the window along with larger signs for the local congressional races. The offices are low-key, one in an alley behind a liquor store on the outskirts of Mankato and another in an out-of-the-way Lakeville office park without any Trump or Republican Party signage. In those offices, the Republican Party says it’s trained 1,400 “Trump Force” volunteer captains, with 400 of them trained in just the last two weeks. On the other side, the DFL Coordinated Campaign and the Harris campaign said they have 24 offices and more than 100 paid staff members. They’ve signed up 14,000 volunteers since the end of July, knocked on 100,000 doors and made 67,000 phone calls. Hann was skeptical about Democrats’ reports of voter contacts and volunteers — numbers that, unlike campaign finance information, do not have to be verified with any regulator. “It’s in the category of rumors and talk,” Hann said. If it is true, Democrats’ push has not yet had a huge impact on public opinion in Minnesota, he said. “If this was all as great as Democrats are telling you, they’d be way up in the polls,” Hann said. Americans for Prosperity, the libertarian-leaning group that supports Republican candidates, is sitting out the presidential race. Instead, it is focusing its efforts on 14 legislative races, with plans to canvass neighborhoods just about daily until the election. Coleman said a mix of paid staff and volunteers aim to contact between 300,000 and 400,000 Minnesota voters by Election Day. “It’s a lot of pounding the pavement” to get out information about their preferred candidates, Coleman said. The pressure is on, he said, because some of the races that delivered Democrats their current state government trifecta were won by just a couple hundred votes. Hann would not discuss specifics of where the state GOP is focusing its efforts or how many voters it hopes to contact by Election Day, saying he did not want to tip his hand to Democrats, but said the party is targeting its on-the-ground contacts with voters on a handful of legislative races. “Everybody knows if Republicans win an additional four seats they become the majority,” he said. But he said the party is interested in competing further up the ballot too. “We want to win them all,” Hann said. For Americans for Prosperity’s part, Coleman said he didn’t think the group has the resources to make a dent in congressional races, much less against Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar. “I don’t think we could put in the resources necessary to push those over the edge,” he said, even if he thought a race could be won. In races in which his group is involved, Coleman said, it seems the candidates themselves are doing most of the work. “I haven’t heard a lot about the state party or the Trump campaign,” Coleman said. First-time candidate Josh Jungling, a Republican running in a Coon Rapids and Anoka district against DFL Rep. Zack Stephenson, said he has gotten some helpful pointers from the House Republican Campaign Committee, the arm of the state party working on legislative races. “It’s all those little things when you’re starting to run for public office,” Jungling said. “Like, how do you put up a four-by-eight[-foot] sign?” Still, he said, the hard work of going door to door to persuade people to vote can be a little lonely for a legislative candidate. “There’s a lot of times you’re just out there by yourself just knocking on doors.”",

Seven districts in the city will benefit from the awards: 38th Street, Cedar Avenue South, Central Avenue, E. Lake Street, Franklin Avenue E., Lowry Avenue N., and W. Broadway. “We’ve got art all throughout the city, in seven different cultural districts,” Mayor Jacob Frey said. “If you are seeing something you’re impressed by, there’s beautiful art that pops up on the street or there’s suddenly people dancing, that is probably the work of our incredible city team.” There are three categories of awards: Cultural District Ambassadors ($15,000 each); Festival and Cultural Spaces Activation Program Awards (ranging from $15,500-$16,700), and Pop-Up Art & Cultural Activations Program ($5,000 each). Each district receives almost $100,000 spread across the three types of awards. The Cultural Districts Arts Fund is the brainchild of Ben Johnson, the first-ever Arts & Cultural Affairs director. He started the job in March 2023, and in a little over a year created this initiative and secured funding for it. His department also set up a separate fund of a quarter of a million dollars for artists to take over vacant storefronts. Recipients will be announced mid-October. Ashely Koudou, founder and CEO of Mango Day, a collective that works with artists, small businesses and entrepreneurs on marketing and branding, became the first-ever cultural district ambassador for Central Av. She has a background in advertising and design. After joining Public Functionary Studios, an organization that helps people of color and marginalized artists’ grow and cultivate their art, she was inspired to work with artists on cultivating their businesses. “With this [cultural district ambassador] initiative, we are able to take it to a different level,” Koudou said. “How do these artists show up in the consumer market?” Johnson sees the awards as just the beginning. “We had almost 300 applicants in this first round of funding, and we awarded 65,” Johnson said. “We know that the next time we do this it will be equally as competitive and popular. That funding will be available next spring.”",

Kyle C. Flor, 24, of Zimmerman, Minn., was sentenced in Sherburne County District Court after pleading guilty to one count of criminal vehicular homicide and two counts of criminal vehicular operation in connection with the crash that occurred shortly after 1 p.m. on June 2, 2023, on southbound Hwy. 169 at 305th Avenue NW. Kelvin O. Gomez-Landero of Honduras did not survive the crash, the State Patrol said. Two men in the car with him survived their injuries. Flor and his passenger, Lukas G. Backlund, 22, of Princeton, were not hurt, the patrol said. Court records in Minnesota show that Flor’s criminal history also includes convictions for underage liquor possession, careless driving and speeding. According to the charges and a later prosecution court filing: Troopers arrived and saw a vehicle off the highway to the right, where it had struck several trees. The car, a Honda, was on its side with the roof sheared off. Gomez-Landero’s body was on the ground in front of the car. Flor, upon returning to the scene, told a deputy he didn’t notice the other car before he signaled and moved to the right lane. He denied knowing there was a collision and continued toward his home. He said he learned of the crash from a witness who followed him. Under further questioning by a trooper, Flor said he had come from the Princeton Golf Course, where he drank one beer and a mixed drink. He said the clutch on his car slipped, sending his vehicle sideways. Flor said that has happened before, so he kept going. The trooper detected a strong odor of alcohol from Flor, who was given a preliminary breath test at the scene that measured his blood alcohol content at 0.094%, above the legal limit for driving in Minnesota. Law enforcement had For’s blood tested and his alcohol content was 0.76%, a touch below the legal limit, but “this clearly impaired his judgment, perception and his overall ability to drive safely,” the prosecution wrote in a court filing ahead of sentencing. The witness who followed Flor said he saw Flor’s Corvette hit the Honda and send the vehicle airborne. The witness followed the speeding Corvette until it stopped. Backlund, a passenger in the Corvette, said Flor had two beers and a mixed drink at the golf course. Backlund said the Corvette jumped to the right and hit the other car after Flor shifted gears. Backlund said he told Flor “several times to pull over” after the crash, according to the complaint.",

        "input": "Headline: An epic paddle took two Minnesotans to the Arctic Ocean\nText: The pack of six wolves appeared swiftly on the horizon, in hot pursuit of a caribou mother and calf in the vast tundra of the Canadian Arctic. Splashing through the Meadowbank River, the predators bore down, indifferent to two paddlers floating into view. Zach Fritz and Taylor Rau watched in amazement from their canoe as the mother fled, leaving the calf behind. Alone, surrounded, the young caribou was no match for the wolves, which pounced and pulled it to shore. The men floated within 30 yards of the bloody scene before the wolves retreated to a nearby hill, shooting back curious glances. Only briefly deterred, the pack returned to the calf as soon as the men passed. By then, Fritz and Rau had been on the move for more than three months, and they were roughly 160 miles away from reaching their goal: the Arctic Ocean. Starting from near Big Falls, Minn., on May 6, they would eventually paddle and portage 2,700 miles over 105 days, through one state, three Canadian provinces and two territories. Along the way, they crossed lakes that dwarfed Mille Lacs, skirted river rapids that could devour them whole and navigated one of the most isolated places on Earth — an area largely untouched by civilization, where muskeg swamps can twist an ankle and mercurial winds can topple even the most experienced paddlers. “Beyond Wilderness” is how renowned explorer Will Steger describes the region, a landscape where there is little margin for error and no safety net. Yet even amid such an otherworldly outpost, Fritz and Rau would recall the wolf attack as a transcendent experience, one that brought a bracing sense of clarity about their place in the world. The adventure “put into perspective pretty quickly how small you are,” Fritz said. They realized it was possible that they were the first humans the animals had ever encountered, and ever would. Fritz, 28, and Rau, 26, didn’t find their way to the Arctic as greenhorns. While growing up in the greater St. Cloud area, both cut their teeth in the Les Voyageurs program. Founded in 1971, the Sartell-based organization has a mission similar to Minnesota wilderness camps like Widjiwagan and Menogyn, teaching life skills by exposing young people to weeks-long adventure expeditions. When Rau enrolled at Les Voyageurs, he was a novice paddler at best. It instantly became his passion. “That first trip for me was, ‘I have to do this more,’” he said. Fritz might have been even more dedicated. Fritz’s dad, Troy, said he has spent exactly one of his son’s birthdays with him since Zach turned 16: The younger Fritz spent all others in or near a canoe. During their time in the program, both men recalled alumni who inspired their imagination with tales of doing the Rediscover North America route from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean and across Canada. “I remember thinking, I’d love to do something like that one day,” Fritz said. Both would eventually guide trips for Les Voyageurs, with Fritz serving as the organization’s program director until last spring. In 2019, Fritz and Rau guided a group of six on the Coppermine River, which stretches from Canada’s Northwest Territories-Nunavut border to the Arctic Ocean. The trip took more than 40 days. “I realized, oh my gosh, the Arctic is very underrated,” Fritz said. “I don’t think people realize how beautiful of a place it is.” Not long after, Fritz was still working on an environmental studies degree at St. John’s University in Collegeville when he began looking at maps and thinking of possibilities. Pieced together with the help of old journals and the advice of veteran paddlers, the route he would eventually settle on linked historic rivers like the Kazan in the Canadian Arctic territory of Nunavut, which runs through a main migratory corridor for caribou, while also relying on trade routes used by the voyageurs and fur traders centuries ago — wild country inhabited eons before them by Indigenous groups including the Cree and Inuit. What began as a “big puzzle of the veins of the landscape” of the northern waters was finalized in 2022. And Fritz decided the trek would begin from a treasured place for the Fritz family — their cabin on the Big Fork River in northern Minnesota. Still, it was one thing to plan a trip and another to actually do it. “I could wake up and keep looking at this [drawn route] every day, or I could go out and see it in person,” Fritz said. “One day it kind of clicked, like I need to take the first step, and I think the first step is reaching out to find somebody who could commit to it, too.” Rau was first on his list. The two began preparing in earnest in the spring of 2023. They restored the gunwales to a 17-foot Dagger canoe, known for its stability in whitewater, and designed, cut and stitched a spray skirt. They prepared and packaged a small mountain of food. Ninety percent was dry goods: They dehydrated meat and fruit and prepared enough venison jerky to feed a football team. They also baked Hudson Bay Bread, a go-to mixture of calorie-dense oats, sugar and butter. The two also sought counsel from those who went before. Bob O’Hara, a retired biology teacher from St. Louis Park, offered maps and experience. He has canoed the far north since the late 1960s and for a time headed to Nunavut’s Baker Lake almost yearly. He worked with Fritz for a year to help plot a route that best tied in big lakes and major rivers. Wind is a chief concern, he said. Dubawnt Lake, west of Hudson Bay, is “like two Mille Lacs,” O’Hara warned, so Fritz came up with an alternate route to stay inland if needed. “There is a lot of situational planning and critical thinking, and no two times are the same,” O’Hara said. “You just have to have your wits about you, and common sense. If you don’t have common sense, you don’t survive. That keeps all the dummies out of there.” After they launched in early May, Fritz and Rau spent the first third of the trip paddling hard through connected waterways. They had the vast Lake of the Woods to conquer. Soon after, they needed 15 days to cross Lake Winnipeg, paddling much of it at night during lighter wind. Some days demanded 10 to 12 hours on the water. By the end of the trip, after so much sitting, Rau had worn through the seat of his Columbia pants. Discipline and daily routine helped the two persevere and steer clear of possible danger. They had three different emergency communication devices tucked among their gear, just in case. And, as O’Hara said, they kept their wits. The two ran some rapids and encountered all classes, but they also “lined” their canoe, walking on shore while using a rope tethered to the Dagger to float it through dangerous water or over rocky ledges. On some fast rivers, they hopped in and out of the canoe repeatedly. Crosses on the shoreline offered reminders, sobering memorials to paddlers lost. “That definitely humbles you a little bit and makes you think, maybe this 10 extra minutes to walk around [the rapids] is worth it,” Rau said. “You also could look out in the river and see a hole that could swallow a house, so that helps, too.” The pair traded roles breaking camp or making meals. Breaks to switch positions in the canoe or eat lunch were dialed-in like clockwork, too. The pattern kept them focused, they said, and gave them a mental edge through the physical toil. They shouldered their 70-pound canoe on portages, in addition to their personal packs and an equipment pack, each of which were also about 70-pounds. Their food pack could weigh double until they ate their way to some reprieve. Sometimes, progress was measured in what seemed like steps, not miles, as they walked their canoe through waters that were drying up or they slogged through deep mud. Other times, in favorable conditions, they would exceed their general goal of 26 miles a day. “It’s challenging because it is day in and day out,” Fritz said. “You don’t get those breaks.” Hazardous interactions with wildlife turned out to be the least of their concerns. Their 12-gauge shotgun stayed in its scabbard. Small pests troubled them more; biting midge flies coated their packs in a buzzing black mass one day, drawing blood and forcing them to their tent. Still, they were fortified by support in varied ways. Fritz’s parents helped deliver the third of four resupplies, driving barrels of food, new maps and even a few books to Southend, Saskatchewan, to meet up with the men at a campsite nearly 50 days into the trip. The last 125 miles of the drive was on gravel. And intense days were balanced with sublime moments — of migrating herds of musk-ox, a bearded bison-like mammal close in size to a small SUV, of curious caribou running through camp, of bears walking the shorelines, indifferent to two passersby, of lake trout so bountiful that their fins rippled on the water’s surface and of that wolf pack that wrestled down a meal after separating it from its mother. The fishing, too, got better as the trip lengthened. So much so, they laughingly recalled having to put their rods away because every cast produced another trophy trout. One snapped Fritz’s fly rod. In the final days of their journey, Fritz and Rau paddled for hours before taking their last strokes along the Chantrey Inlet on the Arctic Ocean. From there, they took a pre-arranged, six-hour boat trip across the sea to the tiny island community of Gjoa Haven. Perhaps fittingly, even that ride was a stark reminder of their whereabouts before their return to modern life: Piled in the back of the boat, they sat atop their gear — and two dead caribou shot by the villagers at the helm. Back home in late August, the men smiled at the memory of a place beyond wilderness. “It might go decades before people go back through these areas [of our route],” Fritz said. “Our goal from this is to inspire others to check out these places. ... “There is a lot of good reason to go through them for fun because you are not going to see other people there. You are going to see a lot of wildlife. You are going to have great fishing. You are going to be able to have that adventure that you can’t get in a lot of other places.”",

        "input": "Headline: Is the design for HCMC’s new parking ramp in downtown Minneapolis going in the right direction?\nText: The ramp is dead; long live the ramp. The Hennepin County Medical Center is tearing down one old ramp to build a new six-story parking facility at 9th Street and Chicago Avenue S. It might provide clues about the complex’s aesthetic future. Hennepin Healthcare also plans to build a 500-patient tower between Chicago and 9th Avenue in the next 10 years, and perhaps the ramp is a taste of things to come. The proposed ramp is a striking structure, with a deep red hue and a minimalistic facade. The problem with hospital design, though, is the way cutting-edge ideas can lose their novelty over time. Perhaps the reason many hospitals seem so off-putting — aside from the connotations of their very existence — is the unfortunate need to make them look modern, as if this indicates you’ll get the best, up-to-date treatment. If you found yourself entering a building that hadn’t been updated since the Victorian era, you might wonder if they were going to treat you with laudanum and leeches. Minneapolis was cursed with two hospitals designed at the worst possible time: the clunky-chunky inhuman, institutional Brutalism. Gray, raw concrete, blocky shapes, overwhelming mass. Grace and humanism were alien ideas to this style. The Phillips-Wangensteen Building on the University of Minnesota campus (516 SE. Delaware St.), part of M Health Fairview, is a massive two-tower complex with vast swaths of windowless walls. It has blocky outcroppings on top, which make it more oppressive. Why taper or set back when you can park the architectural equivalent of a fist on top? The overscaled square masses on top fit into grooves on the side, as if they’re giant elevator cars that pound up and down, smashing anyone beneath. It’s a good thing most of the clinics were moved to a new facility a few years ago. Nothing about this building says “healing.” Everything about this building says “submit.” At the time it was finished in 1976, though, it was the latest thing, which undoubtedly gave the impression that the facilities were state of the art. It was never a beautiful place, but in the recessionary, post-Watergate ‘70s, the future didn’t look all that beautiful, either. The HCMC’s main structure, the Red Building (730 S. 8th St.), is the cousin to Phillip-Wangensteen, but a low-slung version that looks like a castle built by depressed Lego movie characters. If you asked strangers whether it was a hospital or a waste-processing facility, they might be stumped for an answer. Across the street, the new HCMC addition that serves as a complete rebuke to the original structure: the Hennepin Healthcare Clinic and Specialty center (715 S. 8th St.). It faces the HCMC’s Soviet facade with a clean and pleasing blue glass wall, curving like the swirl of a skirt (or hospital gown, if you like), transparent and inviting. Everything about it connotes peace and relief. That’s the direction the new proposed HCMC tower should take. Glass, not concrete. Thin bands of aluminum or steel, not heavy metal panels. A tower that tapers on the top or rounds off — anything but a flat roof that suggests an arbitrary cutoff or an earthbound emotion. Something that not only connotes hope, but uplift. But red? That’s the color of the proposed ramp. Dark red. Is that really the color we want for a hospital? It’s a matter of taste, of course, but whether the color of a soaked garment on an ambulance gurney is right for a hospital doesn’t seem like that hard a call. Blue’s available. Green’s calendar is open. “The red stuff stays on the inside” seems like a good idea for a medical center.",

The proposal, which would sever the dog park from a large segment of the beaches where dogs currently play, has polarized park users ahead of this week’s Park Board (MPRB) meeting, when commissioners approved it without a public hearing. Park Board President Meg Forney and Commissioners Steffanie Musich, Becka Thompson, Cathy Abene, Elizabeth Shaffer and Charles Rucker voted yes over emotional constituent testimonies. Commissioners Tom Olsen, Becky Alper and Billy Menz voted no. Located in Minnehaha Regional Park along the Minneapolis side of the river, the sprawling dog park is the largest in the city and the only one on a waterfront. It’s also the only Minneapolis dog park that isn’t completely fenced in. As a result, some dogs over the years have found their way out through the woods and into traffic. Many dog owners approve of finally building a fence that would safely contain their pets. Others are raising alarms because the project map shows that the proposed fence would cut off large swaths of land that people have considered part of the dog park for decades. “I don’t want to diminish the fact that they are doing a lot of improvements to the actual dog park property,” said park user Arik Van Asten. “But they are drastically changing the use of the overall space.” Musich, whose district includes the Minnehaha Off-Leash Dog Park, said the fencing project is largely being undertaken at the request of NPS, which manages certain land along the Mississippi River. “Installation of fencing in the dog park area is an effort to be good neighbors to adjacent property owners who have different leash rules and prevent off-leash dogs from entering their property,” Musich said in a statement Monday. “MPRB does not own or manage the land outside where the fencing is being proposed, and has been requested to better demarcate the rules and manage access.” On Tuesday, park officials acknowledged that the Park Board is also proposing to fence off from dog use a large stretch of riverfront that it owns. The land surrounding the Minnehaha Off-Leash Dog Park is a jumble of jurisdictions. Contrary to popular use, the actual area of the dog park is contained to a 6.6-acre triangular chunk in the southeast corner of the total area where park users currently let their dogs roam off-leash. NPS owns or manages some land along the river, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs owns adjacent land to the west and the Minnesota Historical Society controls the land to the south, where a pointy beach now serves as a popular rumble zone for dogs Those other landowners have asked the Park Board to erect a fence clearly defining the boundaries between their land and Minneapolis parkland, with NPS offering a federal grant to fund the project, said Park Board project manager Carol HejlStone. That fence would restrict dogs’ access to the river to a smaller stretch of beach, and reduce off-leash dog access to some woods, too. Knowing this would upset members of the public, the Park Board proposed expanding the formal boundaries of the dog park to just under 17 acres of Minnehaha Regional Park land over which it has jurisdiction, she said. In short, while the dog park’s acreage will be legally expanded from 6.6 to 17, the total area where off-leash dogs have had access to for more than 35 years will be constricted in practice. “We understand that dog park users would be upset with the addition of a fence, and so what we were wanting to do is formalize the rest of the MPRB-owned area as off-leash space, which is how it’s been used through time,” said HejlStone on Monday. “But we are intending to cut off access to land that is not owned and maintained by MPRB because those landowners don’t want off-leash dogs on their property.” On Tuesday, NPS Planning Program Manager Forest Eidbo clarified that the National Park Service does not own a long stretch of riverfront north of the Park Board’s proposed fence. Eidbo said NPS manages only the territory around Mni Owe Sni, or Coldwater Spring, a Dakota heritage site in the historic Fort Snelling territory about 1,400 feet inland from the south point of the dog park. In response to NPS’ statement, fencing project manager HejlStone on Tuesday acknowledged that the fence would also cut off a large section of Park Board-owned riverfront property. While Park Board maps do not label it as such, HejlStone called the area a “prairie remnant” that the Park Board wants to protect. “It is a managed natural area and is negatively impacted when off-leash dogs enter the area,” she said. Veterans Affairs spokesperson Melanie Nelson said the VA had “no dog in the fight.” A Change.org petition to “Save Minnehaha Dog Park” is quickly gaining steam, with more than 1,300 signatures gathered in five days. “For 30-plus years people have had access to this and the beach, and we’re talking generations of dog owners and dogs,” said petition organizer Michelle Garens. “It feels really not very transparent, like they were kind of doing the bare minimum of posting, and it wasn’t really clear what was being given up. ... We really haven’t heard from those landowners or had an opportunity to express our point of view.” Park officials had determined earlier that a minimal amount of public engagement would be required because it’s a decision based on “technical, operational or safety constraints only,” over a project thought to “not result in a change in the type, location or extent of the current facility or service.” If approved, the fencing project would be scheduled for completion this fall at an estimated cost of $70,000. About $55,000 of it is coming from a NPS grant. While some dog park users have suggested that the fence money be spent on other social priorities like housing support and food security, federal park funds and Minneapolis Park Board funds are designated for park improvements. Paul Herwig, who has brought his dogs to the Minnehaha Off-Leash Dog Park multiple times a week for about 25 years, described its culture as one that is especially respectful, with the grounds kept clean by volunteers. “I just feel like bringing fencing in and cordoning off stuff is just a real slap in the face,” he said. “It says to me that the people involved in making this decision are really unaware of that culture, and how valuable it is to the very large group of residents who use it.”",

        "input": "Headline: No yard signs. No big donations or debates. These Minnesota political races are unlike many others.\nText: Most offices on the November ballot are familiar: president, senator, judge. But sandwiched between them is a role that often goes unnoticed, one where the race happens on paper but rarely in person. There’s almost no campaign spending. There are almost never yard signs. In the few instances when candidates do knock on doors, people tend to be confused. “I’ve lost count of the number of people that I’ve talked to who weren’t even aware that this was an organization,” said Danielle Holder, a candidate for soil and water supervisor within the Anoka Conservation District. “It doesn’t feel political. It almost feels like the most cordial race you could ever run.” Voters in most Minnesota counties will select soil and water supervisors this November. Soil and water conservation districts trace back to the 1930s, when Congress was hoping to rein in erosion in the aftermath of the Dust Bowl. Over the years, the districts’ work has expanded, with some taking on projects aimed at improving water quality or protecting rare, native plants. The volunteer supervisors serve as advisers for conservation districts, helping to decide which projects get priority for funding, keeping tabs on the organizations’ financials, and building connections within their local communities. “We create relationships with private landowners. We explain the benefits of programs and explain the dollar sources that are available to them,” said Chuck Rau, a supervisor in Benton County and board president for the Minnesota Association of Soil & Water Conservation Districts. Rau is up for re-election this year, running unopposed. Candidates on the ballot this year include farmers, a real estate attorney, a former school nurse, and a parks and recreation worker, among others. Many run unopposed, a testament to the position’s low profile. But this year some races — including in Anoka and Dakota counties — have multiple candidates on the ballot. Colleen Werdien, a former school nurse, became a soil and water supervisor in Anoka County four years ago because she was concerned about the environment and what the world might look like in the future for her nieces and nephews. During her time representing westerns portions of the county, including Anoka and Nowthen, the conservation district has pursued projects aimed at strengthening the integrity of the banks of the Rum River and requested funding to improve the quality of groundwater. Holder, an attorney focusing on real estate issues, decided to run in the same district because she has been interested in environmental issues and has more free time now that her children are getting older. If elected, she hopes to improve outreach and help educate people about small changes they can make, such as planting native grasses in areas where traditional lawns aren’t growing well. Voters will choose between Werdien and Holder — but the pair are quick to point out that it’s been a friendly, relaxed election. “It’s a pretty low-key kind of campaign,” Werdien said, noting that they’ve been asked to appear at just one forum. Their race is hardly an anomaly in the world of soil and water supervisors. Sigrid Lindholm, who grew up on a dairy farm and now lives in Eagan, was surprised to learn that each race in Dakota County has drawn multiple candidates this year. She decided to run partly because she wants to model civic engagement for her daughters. “I see how it’s important for every homeowner, whether they’re living in a city or in the country, to take an active role in helping to preserve the land, helping to conserve water and just being mindful of the actions we take,” Lindholm said. Lindholm is running in a district that includes Eagan and part of Apple Valley. Mark Vaughan is running in a different district that covers the eastern portions of Dakota County, including Hastings and areas to the south. The incumbents they’re facing, Brian Raney and Kevin Chamberlain, didn’t respond to messages from the Minnesota Star Tribune. If selected for soil and water supervisor, Vaughan said he wants to see if there are ways to strengthen efforts to protect water quality. He works in Eagan’s Parks and Recreation Department and spent eight years on the Hastings City Council before deciding not to run for re-election there. After two years away, Vaughan said he has “an itch to get back into policymaking.” But he also wants it to be in a nonpartisan role. “I think it’s today’s society,” Vaughan said. “I just wasn’t ready to be picking a side. I think it’s too divided.”",

        "input": "Headline: Twin Cities suburbs quietly reduce required parking minimums\nText: The Twin Cities suburbs were built as spacious accommodations for a booming population, as well as the rows of cars to ferry all those residents from home to work and back again. To house all those vehicles, the suburbs built parking — swaths of it for strip malls and apartment buildings, seas of it for big box stores. Driveways and garages gave cars their own designated spots, just steps from the door, at home. But as the cost of building housing has ballooned amid a major shortage, some of those suburbs are rethinking the acres of asphalt set aside for cars. In September, St. Paul suburb Falcon Heights joined the ranks of metro cities, including Richfield, West St. Paul and Edina, that have recently reduced — though not eliminated — the minimum number of parking spots city code requires of some new developments. Several cities had recently allowed developments exceptions to parking rules before they changed the code. “We don’t want tons of underutilized parking lots in the city,” said Hannah Lynch, Falcon Heights’ community development coordinator. These changes have happened quietly compared to the splash that followed decisions by Minneapolis and St. Paul in 2021 to stop requiring builders to add any minimum number of parking spots for new developments, among the first U.S. cities to do so. Advocates cheered the elimination of so-called “parking minimums” as a way to prioritize housing, transit, walkability and tax revenue over places to park cars. Opponents worried it would make it harder to drive, diminishing options to live, work and get around cities for the worse. In Falcon Heights, the City Council halved the number of parking spots apartment buildings require. Now, a large complex requires one space per unit, while buildings of under 10 units require 1.25 per unit, assuming they don’t have street parking nearby. Lynch said the city’s old requirements were on the higher side and that many recent Falcon Heights developments have received variances that allowed them to build less than the previous minimum required parking. She described the reduction as a way to cut down on unnecessary parking in the transit-connected city and, by setting a lower minimum, leave it to developers to decide if they want to build more. Not everyone agreed that the parking is unnecessary. “I think it’s pushing something that’s idealist too soon,” Council Member Melanie Leehy said before the vote. The discussion in Falcon Heights echoed arguments made earlier this year at the Minnesota State Capitol during hearings for the People Over Parking Act, a bill that would have eliminated parking minimums statewide, which failed despite bipartisan support. Advocates for the statewide elimination of parking minimums argued space used for parking would be better used to build housing; that parking minimums require developers to spend tens of thousands of dollars to construct parking spots that drive up the cost of housing; and that the market is a better decider of the amount of parking needed than arbitrary government rules. Chuck Marohn, the founder of nonprofit advocacy group Strong Towns and a critic of parking minimums, said the requirements are often mischaracterized as a ban on building parking space. He said the rules are a relic of the zoning codes that characterized the fast development of suburbs in the mid-20th century. Planners studying parking needs at the time would look to new and successful areas, trying to replicate the results. For example, they might study a successful suburban shopping mall and count the parking spots to determine the number of spots per square feet required of retail in another city. Other cities might then copy that ratio. “Nobody writes their own code. Everybody copies someone who copies someone who copies someone who copies someone,” Marohn said, leading, in his view, to arbitrary requirements that don’t fit cities’ needs. A coalition including the League of Minnesota Cities and the City Engineers Association of Minnesota (CEAM) opposed the bill. Marc Culver, CEAM’s legislative committee chair, said his organization opposed the statewide bill’s blanket moratorium on parking minimums because it was too one-size-fits-all. “It’s going to have unintended consequences when it comes to parking on-street, people not being able to park their car when they really need to, near their place of business or near their home,” he said. He also listed concerns about snow plowing with more cars on the street, and the ability of emergency vehicles to get down streets. Culver said he feels differently about cities recalibrating their own parking minimums based on need. “The trips per unit change over time, and the number of cars that people own changes over time, so I think that’s good,” he said. In 2022, Edina reduced its minimum parking requirements for certain types of developments, City Council Member Kate Agnew said. Agnew, who previously served on the planning commission, remembered much discussion was sparked by the Lorient building near 44th and France avenues. The debate was over whether or not a proposed restaurant could arrange for after-hours parking with neighboring businesses to accommodate its needs instead of building more, she said. Earlier this year, Richfield reduced parking minimums for multifamily areas and some other developments. Council Member Sean Hayford Oleary said he had originally pitched eliminating minimum parking altogether, but didn’t have the consensus to move ahead. He said he sees the recent reduction as a way to incrementally reduce unneeded parking. “We have to spend a lot of public dollars subsidizing housing to allow it to be built, so anything that makes housing more expensive to build that isn’t absolutely necessary, is something that we want to look at reducing,” he said. Hayford Oleary pointed to Aster Commons, a supportive housing facility that received a variance to build 11 parking spots for 38 units, with developers arguing many of the complex’s residents will be youth and young adults emerging from homelessness who are more apt to use transit and bikes than cars. The developer estimated savings of $800,000, achieved because the variance eliminated the need for an underground parking garage. Richfield resident Alex Asmus doesn’t agree with Hayford Oleary. As someone who has a degree in construction management, Asmus said he believes reducing parking minimums will give developers an incentive to build less parking than needed because it doesn’t generate much revenue for them. Asmus said the council’s emphasis on adding large apartment buildings has made parts of Richfield, including his once-quiet neighborhood, busier than they were designed to be, something he’s concerned lower parking requirements could exacerbate. Because many neighborhoods in Richfield don’t have sidewalks, pedestrians and kids on bikes use the streets, and more cars parked on streets present more obstacles. And in the winter, he said, snow plows struggled to get through. “Cars have just flooded into our neighborhood,” he said. “We have a lot of young children, when they try to exit their driveways on their bikes into the street, cars fly by and they can’t see a child coming out of their driveway. Because there’s so many cars parked, it’s hard to have that kind of visibility.”",

        "input": "Headline: Park Tavern crash spotlights patchwork of Twin Cities patio regulations\nText: The fatal crash on the patio of Park Tavern last month dredged up unpleasant memories for Jeff Kaster, who owns a downtown St. Paul restaurant that’s been hit by vehicles more than once. “The whole world is so crazy right now. You never know when this stuff is going to happen,” said  Kaster, who owns Bulldog Lowertown. Following what happened at Park Tavern, which left two people dead, Kaster said he’s thinking about adding new protective measures beyond the metal planter boxes that separate his restaurant’s sidewalk seating from the adjacent street. An SUV plowed into the Park Tavern’s outdoor seating area Sept. 1, killing a restaurant employee and a man who was sitting with a group of co-workers. Nine others were injured. Steven Frane Bailey is facing murder and drunken-driving charges. He has been granted conditional release as his case moves through the courts. The tragedy reverberated across the Twin Cities, where weather squeezes the number of days a meal can be enjoyed free from brick and mortar on four sides. And, while drivers slamming into a restaurant’s outside seating remains a rare occurrence, the Park Tavern tragedy wasn’t even the latest reminder that there is risk: Just three weeks later, a driver suspected to be under the influence of opioids crashed into the patio at Clive’s Roadhouse in Blaine. Regulatory protections for outdoor dining vary widely across the metro, and among restaurant owners. Interviews with city officials in Minneapolis, St. Paul and some suburbs found no specific requirements such as distance between tables and streets or parking lots, or protective barriers to separate diners from asphalt. Still, some cities require different levels of regulation. In Minneapolis, eating and drinking establishments must submit plans to the city for where they place patios as a licensing requirement, said city spokeswoman Jessica Olstad. Patios closest to traffic, namely sidewalk cafes, “require a secondary license which submits a seating plan and has insurance requirements,” she said. The city’s four-page regulatory must-do for restaurants wishing to offer sidewalk seating doesn’t directly address safety from vehicles, but it says that “no portion of a sidewalk café (except those with 10 or fewer seats with the approval of Public Works Traffic and Parking Services) shall be located within 10 feet of [a] designated bus stop, taxi stand, traffic signal, crosswalk, pedestrian curb cut, or active loading zone.” In St. Paul, an ordinance calls for restaurants to provide “safety barriers or other enclosures to protect patrons from any hazards, including vehicular traffic.” At the same time, what form those barriers must take — concrete, foliage or plywood or something else — is not specified. “[W]e consider requirements on a case-by-case basis depending on the property and its surroundings,” said Casey Rodriguez of St. Paul’s Department of Safety and Inspections. Rodriguez said his department can impose specific requirements for people’s safety, but “the city must have a basis of facts to support additional requirements on a business or property owner.” In June 2019, an 18-wheeler turned the corner of Wacouta and Sixth streets in Lowertown and struck the Bulldog’s outdoor seating area, dragging some of the metal planter boxes, tables and customers in its wake. No one was killed, though several people were injured. The restaurant petitioned the city to add cement barriers along the sidewalk, but Kaster said he never heard back. The Bulldog moved its outdoor seating farther away from the corner after that crash to better guard patrons from reckless drivers. The restaurant had been through it before: In 2014, a driver chased by the Minnesota State Patrol sped off the Interstate 94 exit and slammed into the side of the Bulldog’s building, injuring several nurses dining inside. “Thank goodness he hit a giant cement support pole that was on the exterior of the building, but he still sent the people right inside the pole to the hospital,” Kaster said. Given the restaurant’s downtown location, Kaster said, he often notices drivers speeding or semitrailer trucks making illegal right turns outside the restaurant. While he doesn’t want additional laws that force restaurants to cover the cost of upgrades, Kaster said he is considering making changes following the Park Tavern crash. “It makes you think, ‘Jeez, do we need to have something that’s more protective?’” he said. In St. Louis Park, there are no ordinances “specifically pertaining to protective measures such as safety barriers on outdoor patios, although safety is an embedded consideration of zoning,” said city spokeswoman Jacque Smith. That city’s numerous requirements are specific when it comes to a patio’s hours of operation, noise levels and proximity to residences and whether a wall or fence is needed. In Minnetonka, city officials have many of the same requirements, but the safety of patio occupants is not addressed head-on. City spokesman Andrew Wittenborg added that unlike sidewalk cafes, with tables and chairs that are easily moved and taken in from time to time, Minnetonka’s establishments with outdoor dining areas are not temporary structures. They are “generally part of or attached to the building itself,” Wittenborg said, making it more likely to offer some distance from vehicles coming and going or passing by. City code in Eagan prohibits outdoor dining areas from being located within a parking lot or other areas where vehicular traffic is intended, such as drive lanes and loading areas. After the pandemic, Wildcats Bar and Grill put up new outdoor seating in its parking lot, built on a raised-pavement patio with cement bollards and metal roofing with beams protecting customers. Eagan city spokeswoman Sara Horwath said the raised curb and bollards were required as part of the restaurant’s application process to protect the patio from vehicles. Wildcats co-owner Kim Dahmah noted that the safety improvements were also recommended by the property company she leases from, and that she doesn’t anticipate making further changes. “I feel confident that ours is pretty safe,” Dahmah said. In interviews, some owners said the Park Tavern crash has led them to re-evaluate their outdoor seating barriers. Others said they have never experienced crashes and don’t anticipate changes. Jeff Veigel, co-owner of Isles Bun and Coffee in south Minneapolis, said he does not have concerns about his bakery’s outdoor seating, which has no protective barriers. He’s owned the bakery since 2000 and it’s never been hit by a car in that time, he said. Metal parking meters and parked cars typically lining the street seem to reduce the risk of someone driving into outdoor seating, he said. “Turning a corner on a city street and accelerating into something, I mean, you’ll see it, but downtown buildings have bollards, and on a lot of city streets you’re going to hit a parking meter or something first,” Veigel said.",

        "input": "Headline: Election could reshape ‘dysfunctional’ Robbinsdale school board\nText: Voters in Robbinsdale will have a chance in November to elect up to three new members to a school board that the district lawyer has deemed “the most dysfunctional board” he’s ever worked with. A 34-page workplace conduct investigation, released last month, included a similar summary of the current Robbinsdale school board: Personal disputes and cross-complaints among at least six of the seven board members resulted in “a high level of dysfunction and animosity in the school board’s operations,” read the investigative report by Red Cedar Consulting. Most of the allegations in the report were not sustained. Of those that were sustained, most qualified as violations of the board’s internal values of respect. Seven candidates are now vying for three open seats on that board. Six of them — Barbara Breher, Greta Evans-Becker, Aviva Hillenbrand, Aileen White, Deborah Campion and Kenneth Wutoh — say moving past that discord would be their top priority if elected. “We didn’t need an investigator to let us know that we were dysfunctional,” said Evans-Becker, the other incumbent running to keep her seat. “A lot of harm has been done, but we have to move past it.” Evans-Becker was the only board member who wasn’t named in the multiple complaints included in the investigative report. Helen Bassett, who is running to keep the seat she’s held since 2021 did not respond to requests for an interview. Robbinsdale Area Public Schools has about 10,400 students and serves all or parts of Brooklyn Center, Brooklyn Park, Crystal, Golden Valley, New Hope, Plymouth and Robbinsdale. Its current superintendent, Teri Staloch, took on the role in July after a failed superintendent search to replace David Engstrom, who resigned in September 2023. An August board meeting to discuss the investigation’s findings devolved into back-and-forth accusations, both old and new, and two motions to censure members. By the end, Board Member Sharon Brooks was censured on a 4-2 vote after widespread confusion about rules of order. “I hate that our school district is now known for a dysfunctional school board as opposed to all the great things that happen,” said Hillenbrand, who works for Minneapolis Community Education. Hillenbrand has two children in Robbinsdale schools and one who graduated from the district. White works as a data specialist in Hopkins schools and started paying attention to school board meetings when her children, now graduated, attended Robbinsdale schools. She wants to see more community involvement and conversation between families and district leaders and worries that the board dysfunction has distracted from that mission. “I hope that the participation of people voting for school board members speaks volumes to Robbinsdale and the board that people are watching,” White said. Campion, who is retired, said she’s “appalled” to see what’s happened to the school board and wants members to be leading conversations about district finances and improving transportation. She worked as a teacher in Australia in the late 1970s and as a substitute teacher in North Dakota before changing careers. Breher, who works for HealthPartners in member services, agreed and said the frustration of watching the board squabble for 20 minutes about rules of order, for example, helped push her to run for a seat. “I think some fresh ideas, fresh — and respectful conversations — are needed to move forward,” she said. Without a functioning school board, Breher worries that enrollment will dip and the district will look less attractive to new teachers. Wutoh, a physical therapist and parent in the district, agreed. Whether it’s one or three new faces on the board, he said he’s hopeful that the election will bring “renewed energy and focus to not make disagreements become personal.” “The seven people at that table need to remember the main reason why they are elected to be there, which is to make sure our kids become successful.”",

As part of his plea agreement, Sharmarke Issa, 42, admitted to running entities that laundered federal funding for the scheme, including Wacan Restaurant LLC and a nonprofit called Minnesota’s Somali Community. Issa was responsible for $7.6 million of the $50 million in fraud scheme money that the federal government says it lost, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Ebert read aloud in court to Issa. The defendant verbally confirmed the timeline and allegations in the plea agreement. Before the hearing in U.S. District Court in downtown Minneapolis, Issa’s attorney Thomas Brever said his client recognized his conduct was wrong. “He’s ready to take the consequences for what he did,” Brever said. “After seeing the evidence in the other trial, he recognized there was a real likelihood of conviction.” Issa resigned from the Public Housing Authority in February 2022, after one of his properties was investigated.  Asked how he pleaded by U.S. District Judge Nancy E. Brasel, Issa said, “Guilty, ma’am.” Under the plea agreement, other charges related to wire fraud and money laundering will be dismissed. While maximum imprisonment for federal wire fraud can be 20 years, Issa likely will receive federal prison time from two years and nine months to three years and five months as part of the plea agreement. That shorter sentence factored in  Issa’s ”lowest” level of criminal history and the fact that he accepted responsibility. The prison time would be followed by a probation period of up to three years, Brasel said during the hearing. Prosecutors have called the Feeding Our Future case, which so far has 70 defendants charged in Minnesota, one of the largest pandemic-era fraud cases in the United States. The defendants are charged with stealing more than $250 million from federal food programs that reimbursed nonprofits, schools and day cares for feeding low-income children. Issa was the 19th person in the case to plead guilty. None of the 19 who pleaded guilty have been sentenced yet, but possible sentences range from about two years to nearly five years in prison. Another five defendants were convicted by a jury earlier this year. Issa claimed to serve 2.3 million meals to children at his food sites. He admitted that some of the fraud scheme money instead went to properties he purchased in Edina, Minneapolis and elsewhere. One example mentioned in the hearing was an Edina house on which Issa spent more than $700,000. Issa agreed to forfeit the properties he bought with fraud money. He was also ordered to pay more than $3.5 million in restitution, the amount he received of the $7.6 million in federal funding paid out to him and his co-defendants. One co-defendant, Haji Salad, is scheduled to appear Thursday in federal court to change his plea as well. Issa will not be placed in custody until after his sentencing, provided he does not violate the other terms of his pre-sentence release.",

The poll’s findings are based on interviews with 800 likely Minnesota voters conducted from Sept. 16 to Sept. 18. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. (Scroll to the end of this article for full results for each question. Click here for the poll methodology, a demographic breakdown of the sample and a map of the poll regions.) But respondents were almost equally divided on whether they view the governor favorably as he runs on Vice President Kamala Harris’ ticket. Forty-eight percent had a favorable opinion of Walz, while 47% were unfavorable. Walz’s opponent for vice president, Republican Sen. JD Vance, is similarly polarizing for Minnesotans, with 91% of Democrats seeing him unfavorably, and 93% of Republicans favorable. Independent voters are split on both Walz and Vance. Half of the politically independent respondents have an unfavorable view of Walz, with 42% approving and 8% unsure. For Vance, 45% disapprove, 40% approve and 16% are not sure what they think of the Ohio senator. Looking back at 2020, 52% of poll respondents said they approved of the way Walz handled the COVID-19 pandemic, and 46% disapproved. Meanwhile, 44% of respondents approved of how Walz handled the protests and riots after Floyd’s murder, and 52% disapproved. Those who approve of Walz said they see him as a dedicated public servant who did well in the face of the pandemic and the protests. “I think he did as good a job as could be expected,” said Bill Engels of St. Louis Park, even if, in hindsight, he thinks some of the COVID restrictions could have been a little more lax. As for the riots in Minneapolis, Engels said he thought Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey deserved a share of the blame for how long it took to call in the National Guard, and said he believed there were both left- and right-wing agitators who were only too happy to see property destruction. Charles Dolson, a Bemidji attorney who grew up on the Red Lake Reservation, said Walz has done a “phenomenal job” as governor and hopes Walz writes a book about his tenure during the pandemic to provide future state executives with a roadmap. Even among Democrats, fewer think Walz handled the 2020 protests well than approve of him overall, though the overwhelming majority of Democrats still think he did a good job. Just over 80% of Democratic respondents approved of the way Walz handled the protests, compared to 94% who approve overall of the job he’s done as governor. Those who do not support him see 2020 very differently. “We had a riot on the George Floyd situation and he did nothing about it,” said Wayne Charles of Kenyon. “I think he’s the poorest governor we’ve had in my lifetime, and I’m 90 years old.” Independent voters in Minnesota were divided on Walz’ handling of the protests. Half of those interviewed disapproved, compared to 42% who approved and 8% who are not sure. Opinions on Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who would succeed Walz if he is elected vice president, are still largely unknown, with 47% of respondents saying they were not sure if they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of her. Even among Democrats, almost a third said they were not sure what they thought. Staff writer Rochelle Olson contributed to this report. FULL RESULTS The Star Tribune, MPR News and KARE 11 interviewed 800 Minnesota registered voters between Sept. 16 and Sept. 18, 2024. All indicated they are likely to vote in the November general election. Findings from questions about Tim Walz’s tenure as governor, GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance and Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan are below. Totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

The Ramsey County Attorney’s Office charged 22-year-old Kueth Chuol Ngut with two counts of second-degree murder. His appeared in court Friday and is scheduled to reappear on Oct. 24. Judge Kelly Olmstead set bail at $3 million. On Friday the St. Paul Police Department identified the victim as Lul Dak Chak, 32, of Ames, Iowa, who bowled with friends sometime before being gunned down. According to charging documents, Ngut and another suspect planned to kill Chak. Just past midnight on Sept. 17, a caller reported hearing gunshots and someone lying on the ground in the parking lot of an apartment building at 1222 University Av. W. Police found Chak with multiple gunshot wounds to his torso, neck and face. He was not breathing. A cell phone, broken necklace and 19 bullet casings were nearby. Medics pronounced him dead at the scene, and an autopsy by the Ramsey County Medical Examiner confirmed that Chak died of nine gunshot wounds. Chak’s cousin witnessed the shooting, telling police that they were smoking outside the apartment complex after returning from a birthday party. Chak told her he was buying narcotics. Moments later, a man exited a Subaru parked in the lot and began shooting at them. The cousin dropped to the ground and said that Chak leaped in front to protect her. A friend who also witnessed the shooting said the three were outside for a smoke when a person wearing all black got out of the front passenger seat of a vehicle and shot at them. They also claimed that the car was in the lot with its headlights off before shots rang out. Investigators reviewed surveillance footage that showed the Subaru driving in the area 20 minutes before the shooting, moving to different spots in the parking lot. When Chak walked outside, two peopled got out of the car and shot at him. He fell to the ground. “The driver walked to [Chak’s] body on the ground, got within 1-2 feet of [him], and fired more rounds into [his] body,” the charging documents read. “From the video it’s apparent that [Chak] was targeted and executed.” Authorities arrested Ngut at his girlfriend’s Minneapolis apartment on Wednesday, but he refused to talk to police. They found a loaded handgun with bullet casings which appeared to match those found at the murder scene. Additional footage showed Ngut arrive at his girlfriend’s apartment hours after the shooting with the Subaru on a tow truck. He was recorded throwing away a white cloth, which investigators recovered and said “appeared to have blood on it and packages for bandages.” Chak’s death marks the 19th homicide in St. Paul so far this year. There were 24 by this time last year, according to a Star Tribune database.",

        "input": "Headline: 2 years in prison for woman who embezzled  $1.1M  from her Edina employer, spent money on luxuries\nText: An Eden Prairie woman has received a two-year term for embezzling more than $1 million over a 7½-year span from the Edina furniture and home furnishing manufacturing company where she worked. Monica R. Svobodny, 52, was sentenced Thursday in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis after pleading guilty to wire fraud for stealing while she was a supply chain and engineering manager at family-owned Sico Inc. In total, Svobodny embezzled more than $1,137,000 from May 2016 to November 2023. Along with her two years in prison, her sentence includes two years of supervised release and an order to make restitution for the full amount that she stole. Ahead of sentencing, prosecutors argued for Svobodny to be sentenced to somewhere close to the bottom of the federal guideline range of 2¾ to nearly 3½ years in prison followed by three years of supervised release. The defense countered that six months of home confinement and a year of supervised release would be more fitting, given that Svobodny “is in possession of the full amount of restitution” and quickly acknowledged her guilt. According to court documents: Svobodny regularly used company credit cards for unauthorized personal expenses such as designer clothing purchases in Las Vegas, and luxury spa services and top-end hotel stays in Edina and Miami. To conceal her fraud, she left unapproved credit card expenses as “pending” for accounting purposes. On more than 300 occasions, she used company cards to transfer money to herself via PayPal to cover personal expenses. Svobodny also edited PayPal transaction receipts and fraudulently listed some of the expenses as payments to a defunct company, “DK Fasteners Corp.” Sico officials caught on to the thefts after noticing a disconnect between its growing product lines and its fiscal health. That led them to review Svobodny’s company credit card. Sico specializes in various forms of folding furnishings, including cafeteria tables, portable stages and portable dance floors for hotels, convention centers and other industries. Along with its Edina headquarters, it has offices in Europe, Asia and Australia.",

        "input": "Headline: Spike in violence tied to Minneapolis’ homeless encampments draws divergent strategies\nText: As law enforcement and policymakers struggle to find answers amid a spike in violence connected to Minneapolis’ numerous homeless encampments, Mayor Jacob Frey is vowing to take firm actions while the City Council is charting its own course about how to cope with a problem that has dogged the city for years. Less than a full day after visiting a murder scene tied to one of the numerous encampments on the South Side, Frey vowed Thursday to accelerate the destruction of the encampments and called out the fentanyl crisis as a major factor. In a 16-hour span Wednesday, three shootings at or near the encampments left two people dead and two others wounded. Police have jailed the man they say is responsible for each of the shootings, and they are building their case in hopes of charging him soon. Frey said in a statement that he went with Police Chief Brian O’Hara to the scene of one of Wednesday’s homicides, and “I saw the victim lying in an alleyway with children playing nearby. Thankfully, our police worked hard to arrest a suspect, but our community cannot be continuously subjected to the violence we’ve seen all too often lately.” Frey pointed out that 22% of shootings in the South Side’s Third Police Precinct have occurred within 500 feet of an encampment. The mayor added that he has directed city staff “to expedite closing encampments and take steps to prevent them from forming in the first place.” And while he pledged the city will continue to do what it can to reverse the prevalence of homelessness, he also said that “the underlying problem is fentanyl — both the trafficking and the use. I’ve directed our police chief to collaborate with law-enforcement partners to get this deadly drug off our streets and focus on arresting those responsible for distributing it.” The city’s policy toward homeless encampments has been a festering political wound for years, as progressive council members have accused Frey of inhumane tactics to clear camps and are exploring ways to legalize them. Meanwhile, Frey, who retains widespread powers to clear encampments, has increasingly felt frustrated by those accusations, as well as the prospect that the council’s progressive majority might enact ordinances to hamstring his authority. Earlier Thursday, the City Council approved three measures related to housing and homelessness: a new set of reporting requirements intended to add transparency to camp removals, including where individuals land after being dispersed; a $1.5 million rehabilitation grant to help a downtown shelter make needed repairs; and an extension of the pre-eviction period for renters from 14 days to 30 days. Frey sees the council’s actions as “trying to prevent the closure of encampments through advocacy, activism, and soon-to-come policy changes. This is irresponsible.” City Council Member Robin Wonsley pushed back in response to Frey’s characterization, saying the measures were needed “in the absence of humane and effective leadership by the administration.” The latest shootings have only have escalated frustrations surrounding the encampments. Residents have expressed concerns about sanitation and safety, while service providers and advocates have argued the city lacks shelter space, affordable housing and other resources. One of the two people shot to death was identified Thursday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office as Roland Scott Littleowl, 20, who was shot in the head Wednesday in an alley in the 2500 block of 17th Avenue S. The shooting, the first of the three within 16 hours, was reported at 4:40 a.m. and also left a man in his 30s critically wounded, police said. The second shooting unfolded four blocks away, in the 2500 block of Bloomington Avenue S., at 4:15 p.m. O’Hara said a man in his 30s was standing by a garage in an alley when a group of people passed by. One in the group approached the man and shot him in the head. In the third incident, a man suffered a potentially life-threatening gunshot wound at 7:20 p.m. in the 2300 block of 17th Avenue S. The suspect was arrested 15 minutes later near E. 26th Street and 17th Avenue S., according to police. Also Thursday, charges were filed stemming from a mass shooting at an encampment on July 15 under the Hiawatha Avenue overpass in south Minneapolis that left a woman dead and seven other people wounded. Half-brothers Dustin Lee Barth Jr., 19, and Steven Alonzo Pruitt Jr., 23, were charged with first-degree riot that resulted in death.

        "input": "Headline: Duluth in ‘near-crisis’ with child care shortage, task force says\nText: DULUTH — A child care task force convened a year ago by former Mayor Emily Larson unveiled its recommendations at a news conference Tuesday, to address what the group deemed a “near-crisis.” Three child care centers here will close this year and four closed last year, with only one center opening. The task force report says the city has just slightly over 3,000 child care slots but 4,200 kids who are 6 or younger with parents who are part of the workforce. Of the options available, nearly 30% don’t take infants. “There are no fast or easy answers” for a profession that needs to be elevated in importance, said April Westman, owner of Aunty’s Child Care in eastern Duluth. “Even through a broken and unsustainable model, child care has long survived due mainly to women doing invisible work for less money, less respect and less trust than they deserve,” she said. Other problems include low wages, licensing and regulation barriers, staff-to-child ratios, facility standards and educational qualifications. Without adequate staff, facilities can’t operate, providers said, and many are lost to higher wages elsewhere. The problems mean parents are pulling out of the workforce or choosing to live elsewhere, Duluth Area Chamber of Commerce President Matt Baumgartner said. The task force, led by Northspan’s Elissa Hansen and the Northland Foundation’s Tony Sertich, recommends that the city create a marketing campaign that prioritizes the child care sector as critical to the economy; fully fund or expand a child care training program; and advocate for policies that help with development of new facilities for centers and for grants and assistance to lessen the burden on providers and parents. Mayor Roger Reinert said that even those not personally impacted by the issue should care, because future growth depends on an inviting environment for families. The city has limited ability to address societal issues like child care, he said, but there are things it can do related to permits for facilities and advocacy to lawmakers.",

        "input": "Headline: Driver and Vehicle Services giving more written tests in Spanish than ever before\nText: Minnesota’s Driver’s License for All law went into effect a year ago, and it has fueled a huge increase in the number of applicants taking their written tests in Spanish. From Oct. 1, 2023, through Sept. 30, 2024, the state’s Driver and Vehicle Services (DVS) administered 113,587 knowledge tests in Spanish, up dramatically from just over 16,100 the previous year, according to state data released this week. Latino and Hispanic residents make up about 6% of the state’s population, according to the U.S. census taken in 2020. But state law that allows anybody to apply for a driver’s license, permit or standard ID card regardless of their immigration status is the main driver behind a 500% increase in tests administered in Spanish, said Jody-Kay Peterson, DVS program director. DVS administered more than 209,900 written tests in English over the past year, the most of any of the eight languages in which tests are available. Spanish was the second most popular followed by Somali, Russian, Vietnamese, Hmong, Karen and American Sign Language. Another 935 applicants chose to have a proctor read the English version of the test questions to them, the data shows. DVS offers tests in eight languages. “We want to make sure anybody intending to drive can be prepared and take a written test,” Peterson said. “We don’t want any barriers.” But has it helped? Just over 57% of applicants who take an English version of the test pass, DVS said. That rate drops to 44% for tests administered in Russian, 40.5% for American Sign Language, 30.6% for Vietnamese and 24% for those taken in Spanish. (Hmong and Somali were even lower.) Test takers who had somebody read questions to them passed 71.8% of the time, DVS data showed. “It could be better,” Peterson said of the results. “People can practice more. They can study more.” In hopes of pushing the pass rate higher, DVS spent several months rewriting the state’s updated driver’s manual that was released this summer and posted online. The agency adopted a 17-step plain-language plan to make it easier to read and understand the laws, Peterson said. “Anybody who has an eighth-grade reading level should be able to understand layman’s terms,” Peterson said. “Jargon and run-on sentences are gone.” Questions appearing on driver’s tests will feature shorter and clearer sentences, with verbiage nearly identical to that in the manual, she said “We want people to be able to say, yes, I understand that,” Peterson said. In another move, DVS on Wednesday released a series of videos to help drivers learn what to expect before, during and after taking their road tests. “If people prepare, know what to expect and pass the test, there will be shorter wait times because there will be less repeat test takers,” said DVS spokesman Mark Karstedt.",

        "input": "Headline: Voters in New Hope and Zumbro Falls received incorrect ballots for House races\nText: Several Minnesota communities are dealing with misprinted ballots after early voting opened Friday for the Nov. 5 election. Hennepin County voters in House District 43A received absentee ballots with the incorrect middle initial for Rep. Cedrick Frazier,  a DFLer, who is running for re-election against Republican challenger Todd Hesemann. Some ballots have Frazier’s middle initial as “B” when it should be listed as “R.” When ballots are misprinted, the Minnesota Supreme Court has to sign off on whatever fix state and local officials propose. In Frazier’s case, the Secretary of State’s office plans to count the ballots with the incorrect initial normally. “Every year stuff like this pops up and every year there are procedures in place to correct it,” said Peter Bartz-Gallagher,  communications director for Secretary of State Steve Simon. On Wednesday evening, Hennepin County election officials acknowledged 28 of the 55,000 absentee ballots they recently sent out were missing the ovals voters fill in, due to a printing error. Elections officials say voters can ask for a new ballot, mark their existing ballot in an obvious way or vote in person at an early voting location or on Election Day. In March, the Hennepin County Board approved a $1.6 million, five-year contract with BlueCrest to automate absentee ballot mailing. County officials send out more than 100,000 ballots during the general election to residents who vote absentee. On Tuesday, Wabasha County officials said voters in Zumbro Falls received mail-in ballots with the District 20A House candidates when they should be voting in the District 20B race. Michael Plante, Wabasha County administrator, said county officials will issue corrected ballots to the affected precinct after the state Supreme Court signs off. Ballots with the errors will be “spoiled” and will not be used in the election. “Wabasha County understands that public trust in the election process is vital and we are working to address this issue as quickly as possible,” Plante said in a statement. Rep. Steve Jacob, R-Altura, represents District 20B which includes Zumbro Falls. He is running for re-election against DFLer Michael Hutchinson. Rep. Pam Altendorf, R-Red Wing, represents District 20A and is running for re-election against Democrat Heather Arndt. “These errors are unacceptable and need to be quickly resolved by the Secretary of State and the County to ensure voters in Zumbro Falls aren’t disenfranchised,” Jacob and Altendorf said in a statement. Zumbro Falls has 155 residents, according to the U.S. Census, who vote entirely by mail. It is unclear how long it will take to correct the ballots. Last week, voters in Faribault County House District 23A received ballots that switched the political affiliation for Rep. Peggy Bennett, a Republican, and DFL challenger Joe Staloch. That error affected only 17 ballots issued by Faribault County, Simon’s office said in a statement Sept. 20. Ballots for the District 23A race from Freeborn, Steele and Waseca counties are accurate. The statement noted that Minnesota’s 87 counties prepare their ballots after they receive a certified list of candidate names and party affiliations from the Secretary of State.",

        "input": "Headline: Yuen: Is there more wiggle room in the ‘shoes-off’ debate?\nText: With so much discord destroying the fabric of our nation today, you might ask why I would care to visit one of the most polarizing issues in our society not once, but twice. Yet here I am, reinvigorating the shoes-off debate with a pot-stirring ladle the size of Shaquille O’Neal’s sneakers. I’ve long held to the principle that it’s common decency to offer to take your shoes off when entering someone’s home — and if you don’t, you’re rude. My July 22 column put forth all the reasons the host should feel no guilt about imposing a shoes-off policy: It’s more hygienic and personable, not to mention well within your right to decide the rules as the person opening up your home to others. Many readers insisted I got it all wrong, perhaps none more than Bob Lazear of Golden Valley, who insisted that I really “stepped in it.” “It seems a bit ungracious to invite someone to your house and then greet them at the door with a surprise mandatory dress code,” Lazear said in a persuasively written email befitting an attorney, which is his profession. “I also question the premise that shoe removal is necessarily more sanitary than leaving them on,” he said. “Before you ask 20 people to pad around your home with their shoes off, you might want to consider that foot and sock hygiene may not always meet your highest standards. I had a cousin whose foot odor could curdle milk.” Another reader, Bruce Imholte of Nisswa, Minn., said he has no problem with taking his shoes off at the host’s request. “What I do not understand is being asked to take off my shoes and then have a dog or two come running into the house with much more dirt than I have,” he said. “I am polite and do not comment, but sure am confused.” Imholte’s email did not convert me to Team Shoes On, but it made me rethink my position, which, any columnist will tell you, is the highest compliment one could ever pay someone with whom they disagreed. I thought of all the times I barked at my kids to remove their shoes when they barged in from the backyard, but then allowed my late 120-pound hound to prance all over the carpet and sleep under the covers with me. (I’d always make sure to wipe his muddy paws with a towel when he came through the door, though.) One reader took issue with my argument that taking one’s shoes off is a Minnesota cultural phenomenon. While often regarded as an east and south Asian custom, it is also widely exercised in Scandinavian countries and other northern European places due to the harsh winter elements. My husband’s family, from northern Minnesota, expected guests to shed their shoes upon entering the home because of the sand, mud and snow clinging to their soles. “You are way off base about shoes in the house in Minnesota in terms of custom,” said Andrea Kircher. “I am 81 years old and have lived here most of my life. I never heard of taking off shoes upon entering a home until recently. It’s a newfangled idea, Laura, driven by other cultures. I think your Minnesota in-laws may be outliers.” Even if they are outliers, I have to admit that I took a shine to my husband when we were still dating when he, unprompted, dutifully slipped off his shoes when meeting my parents for the first time. The gesture of offering to remove your shoes as a houseguest will always leave a positive impression on a host who follows the same rules. Over the summer, Paul Bridgland of Marshall, Minn., had some work done on his air conditioning. The technician had his 4-year-old in tow while working on the AC unit behind Bridgland’s house. Then his son needed to use the bathroom. “As I escorted him inside, he stopped just inside the back door and kicked his shoes off,” Bridgland said. “When I brought him back to his dad, I complimented him for raising a well-mannered son. He glanced up from his work and replied, ‘He took his shoes off, right?’” Other readers spoke of their neuropathy or other feet issues that requires them to wear shoes for balance or support, even when they’re indoors. Look, I’m not a monster. Any guest of mine who must wear shoes out of medical necessity is still welcome in my home. (A doctor’s note is purely optional.) Finally, I heard a cautionary tale warning of the perils of going shoeless that you might think was manufactured by the shoe lobby. So, I’ll just preface by saying Karen Holtmeier generally agrees with my stance of going shoeless. A couple of months ago, Holtmeier invited a relatively new friend over to her condo for pie. That friend, Beverly, asked if she should remove her silver loafers. Holtmeier did not give her instructions either way, but responded that it was her custom to do so. A barefoot Beverly took about two steps beyond Holtmeier’s entryway and said, “Ouch!” Her foot started to bleed. She put a Band-aid on it and the gathering continued. As she finished her pie, she decided to go home while she could still walk. By the next morning, Bev was in urgent care with a foot infection. She eventually underwent surgery to remove a wood fragment about 2 centimeters long and had to recover while wearing a boot. “She still has swelling in her foot, and the doctor told her it might take nine months for it to stop,” Holtmeier said this week. “Where the small projectile came from is still a mystery, although it seems to have come from my carpet.” Bev, Holtmeier says, has been gracious about the incident. Holtmeier has offered to pay her medical bills. They still meet nearly every week for bingo. No matter where you stand on the shoes-off debate, I hope this goes without saying: Don’t let your firmness get in the way of your friendships. And watch out for the cousin with the malodorous feet. In extreme circumstances, rules can be bent.",

The rare confluence of the cosmic events comes with a bonus: a partial lunar eclipse. About 8% of the moon will be dimmed by the Earth’s shadow when the peak of the eclipse occurs at 9:44 p.m. Central Time, according to NASA. Weather permitting, the spectacle in which Earth blocks sunlight from hitting the lunar surface and sometimes turns the surface a striking red will be visible across North and South America and parts of Europe and Africa, the space agency said. And yes, it is safe to view with the naked eye, unlike solar eclipses, which are not, according to Astronomy Magazine. If you miss it, you’ll have to wait until March 14, 2025, when a total lunar eclipse will be visible in the Americas, Western Europe and Western Africa, NASA said. Here is what else will be visible in Tuesday night’s sky: Full moon: This occurs when the side of the moon facing Earth is fully lit up by the sun. Supermoon: This occurs when the moon’s orbit is closest to Earth at the same time the moon is full. On Tuesday, the moon is expected to be about 220,000 miles from Earth, much closer than 250,000 miles when it is furthest away. The moon’s orbit is somewhat of an oval, so its distance from Earth fluctuates. The moon appears larger when it is closer to Earth. Harvest moon:  A full moon that appears closest to the start of autumn. Fall begins at 7:43 a.m. Sunday. The name dates from the time before electricity, when farmers depended on the Moon’s light to harvest their crops late into the night, according to NASA. Blood moon: The moon has a reddish or brownish appearance during a partial or full solar eclipse as Earth blocks the sun from lighting the moon. The atmosphere filters out most of the blue light and the remaining light reflects onto the moon’s surface, making it appear with a red hue.",

        "input": "Headline: Video: Boy, 10, jailed and charged with stealing car, driving through crowded Minneapolis playground\nText: A 10-year-old boy who has been suspected in a variety of crimes, including robbery and auto theft, has been arrested and charged after police say he recklessly drove a stolen car across a crowded Minneapolis school playground, narrowly missing multiple children. The boy was booked Thursday into the Hennepin County Juvenile Detention Center on suspicion of second-degree assault in connection with what happened at the playground about 11:45 a.m. on Sept. 20, a school day, outside Nellie Stone Johnson Community School in the 800 block of 27th Avenue N., police said. Friday’s charges allege reckless driving and receiving stolen property. Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the boy also was charged with threats of violence and attempt to commit an auto theft related to an August incident, when he wielded a knife and threatened a female motorist, allegedly telling her, “I will gut you.” Police records indicate that the boy, whose identity is being withheld by law enforcement because of his age, has at least 30 contacts with police dating to May 2023. He has been arrested at least twice before for auto theft-related crimes, according to police. He’s also listed as a suspect in more than 12 cases that range from auto theft to robbery to assault with a dangerous weapon. The remaining entries are mostly related to cases involving running away, police said. Police records say one of the boy’s auto thefts occurred late last year when he was 9 years old and stood 5 feet tall. The boy’s mother told the Star Tribune that her son was due in court Friday afternoon on allegations of stealing the car and “assaulting the person whose car it was.” The Star Tribune is not identifying her in order to protect the boy’s identity. The woman, who lives in Minneapolis, acknowledged that her son steals cars, “but why he does it, I don’t know. He doesn’t come from a bad home. I’m a single mom. His father passed away.” She pointed to “kids who are in the community who are older and getting him into that. He’s traumatized by these older kids. ... I want my son to get help. He’s a 10-year-old kid.” In a news conference Friday with the playground as a backdrop, O’Hara expressed concern about the increasingly younger offenders officers are encountering. Kia and Hyundai thefts by teens have escalated to more serious crimes in recent years, he said. A Hyundai was stolen in this case. “This is a situation where a mother — who I believe is a good parent — has been asking the system for help and the system has been failing her and been failing her child,” the chief said. “It’s disappointing to the community that when the police do bring someone like this in … that the system doesn’t have an answer for what to do with someone this young.” O’Hara blasted a state law set to take effect in 2026 that raises the minimum age of delinquency from 10 to 13. He encouraged people to call their state representatives and ask that they reverse the law before it kicks in, “simply as a matter of public safety.” The chief said the boy’s mother refers to the juvenile system as “the devil’s playground because kids are not seeing consequences and, in her words, they’re doing this for entertainment and not being held accountable.” O’Hara said police will sometimes refer troubled children to child protective services, but said that was not appropriate in this particular case. ”This is not an issue of the parent being neglectful,” he said. O’Hara and Lt. Kelly O’Rourke, who oversees MPD’s juvenile division, bemoaned the lack of suitable placement options for youths, where they can be safely detained while undergoing mental health evaluations and intensive treatment. “It’s a loophole in the system,” O’Rourke said. ”The kids are bankrupting the system by continuing to complete more and more crimes while they’re waiting for these providers to reach them out in the environment.” In the school playground incident, the boy drove the car on the grass and sidewalk between the school and the playground, where the kindergartners were enjoying a sunny day, according to police. Surveillance video released Friday by police shows school staff frantically trying to move children off the playground and out of harm’s way as the car buzzes close by multiple times. The boy’s head is barely visible just above the bottom of the driver’s side window of the 2013 Hyundai, a model that’s been a favorite of thieves for several years. O’Hara said in a statement that the 10-year-old’s family is cooperating with police and has asked for help to keep the boy or anyone else from being injured or killed. “It is unfathomable that a 10-year-old boy has been involved in this level of criminal activity without effective intervention,” O’Hara’s statement read. “Prison is not an acceptable option for a 10-year-old boy. But the adults who can stop this behavior going forward must act now to help this child and his family. “This is only one example of the revolving door we’re dealing with — arresting and rearresting the same juveniles for auto theft and other violent crimes. This is a complex issue, and we need every entity involved in intervention to come together immediately to establish short- and long-term solutions.” Later Friday, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said in a statement that the boy has been charged “because of the very significant safety implications both for this child and the broader community.” While the statement from County Attorney Mary Moriarty’s office announcing the charges in juvenile court said the law prevents prosecutors from saying more about this case, a person, including a child, cannot be prosecuted if they are not capable of understanding the legal proceedings or assisting their lawyer in their defense. A court-appointed psychologist makes a recommendation on competency to a judge, and the judge makes the decision. If a child is found not competent by the court, the case must be dismissed or suspended, and the child must be released from custody. “We are facing an urgent crisis in our community related to a small group of children who are not competent to stand trial in the juvenile justice system, but who cannot safely be at home,” the statement continued. “We are actively engaged with law enforcement, as well as county and state partners, about the critical need for safe and appropriate out-of-home placements for children with these complex needs who require specialized care. We cannot charge or prosecute our way out of this crisis. “What we need is clear: residential placements with varying levels of security in our community that are resourced and staffed to be able to accept and successfully treat our youth with complex needs. And we need urgent and immediate action to address this issue now.”",

        "input": "Headline: Brooks: The Audacity of Ope? Wisconsin breweries battle over Tim Walz-inspired beer\nText: Two Wisconsin breweries are locked in a battle over ope-branded brewskis with Gov. Tim Walz’s face on the can. There’s a lot to unpack in that sentence, but I cannot emphasize enough that someone has trademarked ope-branded beer and it is not someone in Minnesota. In fair Wisconsin, where we set our tale, Minocqua Brewing Co. launched its latest progressive-themed beverage a few weeks ago — a can branded with the smiling face of Democratic vice presidential nominee Walz, under the words “OPE.” The beer is described as having “big dad energy,” and fits with Minocqua’s left-leaning offerings. But Wisconsin already has an Ope brewing company — the Ope Brewing Co. of West Allis. And Ope holds the Wisconsin trademark on ope-based beverages (their ope-ful request for a federal trademark is pending.) “After we released “OPE: A Lager with Big Dad Energy” a few weeks ago, we got a call from an attorney who represented Ope Brewing in West Allis, Wisconsin. They said we stole their trademark.” So began the version of events Minocqua posted on Facebook Wednesday. “We giggled a bit, thinking, ‘How is it possible to trademark a word that most Midwesterners use as a way of saying “excuse me”?’” As the dispute escalated into waspish social media exchanges between fans of the two brewing companies, Ope explained that it does hold the trademark and it doesn’t run around naming its beers after Minocqua labels. A lawsuit was filed. A judge scooched on by with a temporary restraining order on those cans of Walz-inspired beer. And then the dispute appears to have escalated to Audacity of Ope level. “Despite the fact that it never used the term ‘Ope’ prior to August 9, Minocqua Brewing has even taken the tactic of filing a motion to extend the time to oppose our federal trademark — a truly underhanded move that appears to be retaliatory for the lawsuit and the Temporary Restraining Order,” Ope Brewing posted Thursday. Minocqua, meanwhile, has rebranded and is now printing the governor of Minnesota’s face on cans of Big Dad Energy-label beer, which does not rhyme but is probably a catchier name anyway. Minocqua owner Kirk Bangstad,  no stranger to legal drama, has not yet responded to an interview request. “Ultimately, this all comes down to respect and keeping our small business alive, including protecting the rights in and to the name ‘Ope’ in relation to our products and services,” Ope wrote at the end of its Thursday post. The company declined a request for an interview.  “We have no problem if you want to buy ‘Big Dad Energy’ from Minocqua Brewing. We also ask that you do not post comments attacking or even defending either brewery. All we ask is that everyone be kind, respectful, and excellent to each other. Cheers.” Let the record show that the Minnesota secretary of state’s office shows many, many ope-branded businesses in Minnesota, but still somehow not as many as you might expect. These include but are not limited to: Ope BBQ, Ope Industries, Ope Dope, Ope is Dope, Opelandia and Ope It’s Cold. Further investigation reveals an Ope It’s Soap over the border in Chippewa Falls. This great nation is open for business.  So, may both small brewing companies prosper, long may their beer flow, and may someone report back soon about what Ope beer and Walz-branded beer taste like.",

        "input": "Headline: This Twin Cities school is locking up cellphones. How’s it working out?\nText: The name on the jerseys is Pioneers, and when it comes to classroom cellphone bans, Hill-Murray School in Maplewood is helping to lead in a learned way. President Melissa Dan had students ditching their devices in a previous job five years ago. Now, Hill-Murray is building on its year-old in-class ban by requiring students to lock their phones in Yondr pouches for the entire day. The sleeves, which lock when shut, have become fixtures at phone-free gigs by artists like Bob Dylan, Jack White and Dave Chappelle. There’s been grumbling and complaints, to be sure, and rule breaking, too. Last week, a student became a repeat offender by responding to Assistant Principal Aaron Benner with a text from a burner phone. But when the school day ended last Wednesday, there was no mad rush of students eager to unlock pouches and scroll through screens. Most appeared willing to at least wait until they got outside. “Would we like to check our phones occasionally? Yes,” said senior Kaylin Gruber. “But this is just how it’s going to be. We’re all just kind of accepting that now.” School began this year with districts seizing on advice from the state’s elementary and secondary school principals that phones be put away for the day. The resulting news coverage was so extensive that Terry Morrow, general counsel of the Minnesota School Boards Association, said many members called him thinking a statewide ban already was in place. Everyone is free to set their own policies, and in the case of Hill-Murray and several other metro-area Catholic schools, the decision was made to double down on phone-free crackdowns with Yondr pouches — which also are being put in use for the first time this fall at Andersen United Middle School in Minneapolis. In her previous position at School of the Holy Child in Rye, N.Y., Dan instituted a cellphone ban, citing the device’s negative effects on learning and development of social skills. She relayed that message to the Hill-Murray community in July, and shared what a Google executive in New York told her about restricting his own child’s access to social media. “He said, ‘This technology and these apps are designed to be as addictive as possible. Why would I want to expose my daughter to this?’” Dan said. Last year, Hill-Murray high-schoolers could use their phones between classes and at lunch. Now, they and all middle students must begin the day by snapping them shut in the school-issued pouches, purchased by Hill-Murray with federal COVID relief money. Hill-Murray has nearly 1,100 students, and Dan acknowledges they weren’t thrilled with the Yondr pouches. In fact, she spoke that day with a few “who are still really mad at me,” she said. This summer, when Gruber pulled up an email describing the new policy, she said her immediate reaction was: “What the heck?” She is 18; a responsible person; an honor roll student, too. The school is trying to control us, she recalled thinking, it is taking our freedom away. Now, she is more understanding. She is seeing some benefits. And she has gotten over the opening-day shock of unlocking a phone that hadn’t blown up with notifications. Wait, Gruber thought, “I’m so popular,” she recalled in a tongue-in-cheek way. Then, she realized everyone else had their phones locked up, too. Gruber and others describe a lunch room that is louder and livelier with kids engaged not only with friends but also classmates they might not have spoken to previously. Friends meet face-to-face in hallways during passing time, yet are arriving to class more quickly. Generally, they seem “more present,” they say. The school made clear, too, that anyone with anxiety over the change can speak to a counselor, said senior Abby Haldorson. But many students also miss their phones. After freeing her device by placing it on a magnetic unlocking base, Gisele Parnell, a ninth-grader, said she’d prefer to be able to text friends during the day about after-school plans. Sometimes, she said, she needs to get in touch with her mom to arrange a ride home. But she also says she’s more focused in class. Overall? “I am still opposed to this,” Parnell said. “I don’t like it.” Rebecca Fandrich, a theology teacher, enjoys not having to worry about kids sneaking peeks at phones. They’re on task, she said. She also oversees dozens engaged in service learning and makes sure they have their phones with them when they tutor at local elementary and middle schools. “They go out, they serve, then they come back and they lock it up with me,” Fandrich said. Benner, the assistant principal, said the student busted with the burner phone will have to spend a half-hour in detention. He says he’s collecting about two phones a day, not bad for the number of kids at Hill-Murray, he said. Communication between students and with teachers is on the rise, and Benner is predicting great things — perhaps a day when pouches aren’t needed and the change in climate is such that students can carry phones in their backpacks or even set them on the desk alongside them and still resist the desire to check them. “Maybe that’s wishful thinking,” he said. “But that’s my goal.”",

        "input": "Headline: Olmsted County looks at $7 million levy increase for 2025\nText: ROCHESTER – Olmsted County officials plan to raise property taxes by about $7 million in 2025, close to a 6% increase compared with this year. The Olmsted County Board on Tuesday approved a preliminary tax levy of almost $133 million for next year, though the board could cut that down by the time it finalizes the 2025 budget in December. The county has yet to calculate specific impacts to homeowners, according to Wilfredo Roman-Catala, the county’s chief financial officer. Some of the increase will be offset by new commercial property; property value increases will likely make up part of the increase as well. Olmsted County will use part of the levy increase toward more public works projects, including work on the county’s government center, Hwy. 14 improvements and expansion efforts at Graham Park among other issues. “It’s a balancing act for us as a board to respond to community expectation ... and also to protect our taxpayers,” Board Chair Sheila Kiscaden said. The board’s levy decision comes a week after the Rochester City Council set the city’s 2025 levy at just under 10%, with a little under $10 million added to Rochester’s property tax levy. City officials initially budgeted the Rochester levy at a 10.4% increase but council members trimmed a planned auditor position as well as snowmaking equipment purchases to bring the preliminary levy down.",

        "input": "Headline: Juror, victim family members call for release of Minneapolis man serving life sentence for murder\nText: A juror who sent a Minneapolis man to prison for life and the sister of the man he was convicted of murdering sat side-by-side at the Hennepin County Government Center Monday and said a grave injustice has taken place. Fifteen years ago, Edgar Barrientos was convicted in the drive-by shooting death of Jesse Leon Omar Mickelson. Mickelson, an 18-year-old Minneapolis Roosevelt High School student, was playing football in the alley behind his house when he was killed. Barrientos was 26 years old when he was sentenced to life in prison a year later. “Everybody wanted it to be [Barrientos] so bad, but I want what’s right — and right is right and wrong is wrong and he wasn’t the man who killed my brother,” said Mickelson’s sister, Tina Rosebear. “I hope they can release him as soon as possible.” The case against Barrientos came under heavy question after the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office Conviction Review Unit (CRU) released the results of a three-year investigation into his conviction last month. In a scathing review of the case, the CRU blamed Minneapolis police, Hennepin County prosecutors and Barrientos’ defense team for a “confluence of errors” that led to a wrongful conviction. They argue that “because his conviction lacks integrity, the CRU recommends that his conviction be vacated, and the charges dismissed.” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said at a news conference that Barrientos should be a free man and if Judge John McBride agrees to post-conviction relief, her office will dismiss all charges. Sarah Wolf was one of the jurors who convicted Barrientos. She developed a lasting connection with Rosebear after the trial. After the CRU report was released, Rosebear sent it to Wolf. She got to page 30 before realizing she convicted an innocent man. “I don’t feel like I was duped. I’m a smart person and I make my own decisions,” Wolf said. “I get angry at the police for making such quick decisions and not following the evidence that was there. They made a decision to go after Edgar.” The CRU report highlighted that no physical evidence tied Barrientos to the crime. Surveillance video showed Barrientos with his girlfriend in a grocery store in Maplewood 33 minutes before the shooting in south Minneapolis. Barrientos also had a credible alibi that he was in his girlfriend’s apartment in a suburb of St. Paul at the time of the shooting — an alibi his defense failed to properly argue for the jury. During the investigation, police recreated the route Barrientos would have taken from the grocery store to the scene of the crime and told the jury he could have made the drive with plenty of time to shoot Mickelson. The CRU worked with a retired officer from MPD who provided an expert report that rejected that investigation and said the drive likely would have taken more than 33 minutes, making it “improbable, if not impossible, for Barrientos to be the shooter.” Wolf pointed to what she said were three glaring issues with how evidence was presented to the jury: the manipulation of the mugshot of Barrientos, specifically the description of his hair; the inadequacy of the defense team that represented Barrientos; and that the jury was not instructed about giving proper weight to eyewitness testimony. “Of course we now know that eyewitnesses get stuff wrong or they’re set out to actually pin it on somebody else,” Wolf said. Every eyewitness to the shooting said the suspect was bald, so police used old photos of Barrientos with a bald head in photo arrays, even though they knew grocery store surveillance video from the night of the shooting showed Barrientos with a “full head of dark hair.” The lead investigator and Hennepin County prosecutors then lied during the trial, the CRU determined, by saying witnesses had described the suspect as having “short hair” when they had said the shooter was bald or had a shaved head. Police also had “conducted suggestive and coercive interviews with juvenile members of a rival gang” to label Barrientos the shooter. They threatened another juvenile who was a victim in the shooting by implying that if he didn’t name Barrientos they could label him an accomplice to the crime. Another eyewitness, who was not gang affiliated, picked someone other than Barrientos out of the lineup. Investigators also failed to use proper protocol for giving witnesses photo arrays and Barrientos’ defense attorneys “failed to present the district court with substantive written or oral arguments regarding the unreliability of the lineups and the tainted lineup procedures.” Moriarty called into question the tactics used to gain the initial conviction. “Prosecutors from this office and investigators from the Minneapolis Police Department ignored the obvious evidence before them and failed to follow known best practices to convict the man they convinced themselves was responsible for the murder,” she said. “We are sorry to both Mr. Barrientos and his family and to the family of Jesse Mickelson.” The two police investigators involved in the case were Robert Dale and Christopher Gaiters. Gaiters is now one of the second-highest ranking officers at MPD, serving as assistant chief of community trust. Dale retired in 2023 as a homicide sergeant. Hilary Lindell Caligiuri, one of the Hennepin County prosecutors who tried the case, was appointed a Hennepin County judge by Gov. Mark Dayton in 2014. Her current term runs through 2028. Kristi McNeilly, who represented Barrientos, was later found guilty of swindling one of her clients and sentenced to 180 days in the workhouse and ordered to pay $15,000 restitution. Her law license is suspended. When this review comes to a conclusion, Moriarty said her office will be inviting members of MPD to sit down and discuss how they can work together to ensure this doesn’t happen again. The HCAO sent a letter to the court Monday in support of releasing Barrientos, writing that, “We do not reach this decision lightly and we do not reach it with any joy. This has been a terrible process for Jesse Mickelson’s family.” Rosebear said reliving the pain of her brother’s death has been a trauma, but it doesn’t change how she feels about what needs to happen next. “It’s been 16 years but I would rather have no conviction than the wrong conviction,” Rosebear said. “I want to apologize to Edgar and his family for everything they have endured. ... I want to apologize most importantly because I held a lot of anger for a man who had nothing to do with it.” Wolf said she didn’t feel manipulated by the criminal justice system as a juror taking part in the conviction, but her voice shook as she explained the feelings that have washed over her since reading the CRU report. “I would not have made that decision having known what I know now,” she said. “But I wish I would have known then, because we can’t take back what we did.” Moriarty said if the case is dismissed, an investigation could be opened into other suspects in the slaying. Barrientos, 41, is serving his life sentence at the Minnesota Department of Corrections Facility in Rush City.",

        "input": "Headline: Suspect in fatal shooting of 2 on same day near Minneapolis homeless encampments charged in one killing\nText: A longtime street gang member was charged Friday with fatally shooting a man near a Minneapolis homeless encampment, believed to be his second such killing of the day, and then wounding another man near a different encampment hours later. Joshua Anthony Jones, 36, of Bemidji, was charged in Hennepin County District Court with second-degree murder in connection with the shooting of Robert Milton Brown, 39, of Minneapolis, around 4:15 p.m. Wednesday in an alley in the 2500 block of Bloomington Avenue S. About three hours later, prosecutors say, Jones shot a man 24th Street and 18th Avenue S. Jones is charged with second-degree attempted murder in that incident. Officers arrested Jones within 15 minutes of his third alleged shooting of the day. Police also believe that Jones is the gunman who killed Roland Scott Littleowl, 20, who died after being shot in the head about 4:40 a.m. in an alley in the 2500 block of 17th Avenue S. The shooting also left a man in his 30s wounded, police said. The three shootings spanned less than 15 hours, occurred within a several-block perimeter and involved the victims’ heads being targeted. The charges are unclear how well the men might have known Jones. The charges also did not address a motive for the shootings. Jones remains jailed in lieu of $1 million bail and awaits a court date for the cases filed Friday. Court records do not list an attorney for him. He’s due in court Monday regarding an assault charge alleging that he shot a man near a south Minneapolis light-rail station in March. Prosecutors said in Friday’s charges that Jones has been a longtime member of the Native Mob street gang that is active in south Minneapolis and elsewhere in Minnesota. His criminal history includes convictions for assault and fleeing police. “Although the investigation is ongoing, it appears that Mr. Jones targeted several individuals over a short time span, taking two lives and harming three other victims,” County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement. Moriarty added that although these attacks do not appear to be targeting people because they are homeless, “we know that that is little comfort to them. Everyone deserves to feel safe, housed or not, and our office will work to ensure that they do.” She said further investigation is underway that could lead to more charges being filed against Jones. On Thursday, Mayor Jacob Frey vowed to accelerate the destruction of the encampments and called out the fentanyl crisis as a major factor. Also on Thursday, the Minneapolis City Council approved measures related to housing and homelessness: a new set of reporting requirements intended to add transparency to camp removals, including where individuals land after being dispersed; a $1.5 million rehabilitation grant to help a downtown shelter make needed repairs; and an extension of the pre-eviction notification period for renters from 14 days to 30 days. According to the latest charges against Jones: Officers were dispatched to a shooting in the alley late in the afternoon and saw Brown had been shot in the head. Emergency medical providers declared him dead at the scene. One 9-millimeter cartridge casing was next to his body. Police reviewed surveillance video and saw that Brown “was standing peacefully in the alley” before Jones pointed a handgun at Brown’s head at close range, the charges said. Brown “put his hands up, bent his knees and hips, and cowered on the ground,” according to the charges. Jones paused for a moment, then shot Brown in the head, sending his victim face-up to the pavement. Jones uttered a racial epithet and walked away. Then about 7:20 p.m., a 34-year-old man was hunted down by Jones until the victim was shot in the back of his right shoulder near 24th Street and 18th Avenue S. The man said he was fixing the chain on his bicycle and saw Jones arrive in an SUV. He recognized Jones from past interactions, including drug dealing. Jones hollered a racial epithet, approached the man from behind and aimed a gun at his head. The man jumped just as Jones fired one shot. The man started running, and Jones chased him while continuing to shoot. Jones finally hit the man in the shoulder while the man was hiding behind a vehicle. An earlier shot grazed the man’s head. The man took off running again, this time until taking cover in a park building. Jones gave up the chase at that point. Shortly after 7:30 p.m., officers found Jones and arrested him at gunpoint. Discharged cartridge casings at all three shooting scenes were analyzed and they appear to come from the same gun.",

Biden picked Provinzino in June to replace Judge Wilhemina Wright, who was once on a shortlist for the U.S. Supreme Court before retiring at the beginning of this year. Provinzino was selected from a list of candidates sent by Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith that was gathered by a judicial selection committee chaired by former Minnesota Appeals Judge Lucinda Jesson. Provinzino was confirmed in a 54-41 floor vote. Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz, who will swear in Provinzino at a date yet to be announced, called her a “welcome addition to our Court.” “She has been appearing before our judges for almost 15 years, and she has skillfully handled some of the most difficult cases prosecuted in our District,” Schiltz said in a statement. “She is exceptionally smart, she is an elegant writer, she is always well prepared, and she treats everyone she encounters with kindness. These traits will serve her well in her new role.” A victory by former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election could have thrown Provinsino’s nomination into uncertainty. Klobuchar said bipartisan support for Provinzino, which included law enforcement, helped her advance through the confirmation process more quickly than the more than a dozen other nominees still awaiting a full vote. “It isn’t easy getting someone confirmed before the election,” Klobuchar said in an interview after the vote. “So just because there’s a bunch of them that are held up right now, I wanted to make sure that we put forward someone who was a stellar nominee.” Smith congratulated Provinzino in a statement and said her “decades of experience advancing justice and protecting the rule of law will make her an exceptionally well-qualified” judge. Klobuchar has emphasized Provinzino’s St. Cloud roots and that she has spent her entire legal career in Minnesota. Provinzino has worked as a federal prosecutor in Minnesota since 2010. She was part of the prosecution team that won a child sex trafficking conviction of GOP operative Anton Lazzaro last year and prosecuted a Thai-based international sex trafficking conspiracy that victimized hundreds of women. For the latter prosecution, Provinzino received the Attorney General’s David Margolis Award for Exceptional Service, the top award given by the Justice Department to its employees. “I am so proud that, after a long and distinguished career as a prosecutor, Laura Provinzino will now serve our community as a federal judge,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger said in a statement. “We are fortunate that she will continue to serve the cause of justice in this new and critical role.” Provinzino, 48, was one of three prosecutors who secured Lazzaro’s guilty verdict. The businessman and former Republican activist was sentenced to 21 years in prison on charges involving five 15- to 16-year-old girls who he paid to have sex with him. Before joining the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minnesota, Provinzino served as a law clerk for Eighth Circuit Judge Diana Murphy in 2003-2004 and worked as an associate at Robins Kaplan. Her education includes a law degree from Yale Law School, a Rhodes Scholarship to attend Oxford University and a bachelor’s degree with honors from Lewis & Clark College.",

The troopers weren’t going on trial. They had arrested a man who allegedly fled a traffic stop before a State Patrol helicopter traced him to an apartment where he was found hiding under a bed with a gun and drugs nearby. The motion asking for misconduct records, known as a “Brady-Giglio review,” represents a new tactic for how the Attorney’s Office is approaching the legal obligation for gathering and sharing evidence of police misconduct under Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty. In the past eight months, the office has filed that same motion nearly 600 times. There is nothing new legally about the need to gather and share Brady-Giglio information. The legal requirement stems from two U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 1963 and 1972 regarding due process. In practical terms, prosecutors need to disclose to the defense any information about a case that would benefit the person charged with a crime or any question about the credibility of a potential witness. In the past, prosecutors and law enforcement typically worked together to gather pertinent data related to police misconduct or questions about witness credibility. Then they’d share it with the defense ahead of trial. But, if a police department didn’t disclose pieces of disciplinary information or a prosecutor didn’t push to obtain it, a case could be overturned on appeal. Kevin Burke spent 10 years as chief judge of Hennepin County District Court, before retiring in 2020. He said Brady-Giglio has been around for decades, nearly every practicing lawyer in the United States grew up with it and there have been “egregious examples” of it not being complied with ever since. “Some police departments have not been as forthright in providing material,” Burke said. “I think that if you’re a prosecutor, putting this outside of Hennepin, just a prosecutor anyplace, if you don’t comply ... it’s a post-conviction proceeding waiting to happen.” Moriarty told the Star Tribune in January that her office was taking a more proactive approach in gathering Brady-Giglio information to follow those Supreme Court decisions. That announcement kept with her two core campaign promises: that she would hold police accountable and her office would be more transparent about how they operate. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office declined to comment for this story, but provided data on its use of the motion. When asked if it was filing court orders for Brady-Giglio data, the Ramsey County Attorney’s Office provided a link to its internal policy, which says its prosecutors are not limited in any way in trying to gather that information. The Anoka County and Dakota County attorney’s offices said they are not filing motions in a similar manner to Hennepin County. The Hennepin County Public Defender’s Office didn’t respond to a request for comment. Jeff Potts, the executive director of the Minnesota Chief of Police Association, said Moriarty’s positioning stands in contrast with other counties in the state and how law enforcement worked with Hennepin County in the past. “I would say that it’s probably indicative of the relationship that she is creating with the police chiefs,” Potts said. “Most other county attorneys are doing this in a way that is probably equally effective. However, their style is more cooperative and collaborative. This county attorney has chosen to use court orders to obtain information.” The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office wouldn’t discuss its process around Brady-Giglio on the record. But its memorandum arguing for the motion, written by Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Siara Melius, explains that obtaining private disciplinary data against law enforcement is the office’s “legal obligation and authority.” Melius was hired for her expertise on Brady-Giglio compliance, and her motion zeroes in on what information is considered protected under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act. She argues that several examples of private law enforcement discipline, including officer misconduct cases that are still being processed or when a police chief rules that an officer violated policy but didn’t impose discipline, could be pertinent to a case. That means the Attorney’s Office has a legal obligation to gather and share it. Melius also points to a Minnesota Court of Appeals decision from 1985 when the Minnesota Department of Human Rights issued a subpoena to investigate  St. Paul over a claim of discriminatory hiring for a firefighter position. St. Paul twice refused to comply with the subpoena. The Court of Appeals ruled the Department of Human Rights had the authority to review the data in order to identify if discrimination had taken place. While it enforces criminal laws, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office positions itself as no different than the Department of Human Rights, which enforces civil rights laws. The Attorney’s Office also points to a Minnesota legal statute which says government agencies in Minnesota should have shared access to classified data when it is required by federal law. The motion notes that even if all of these state laws went against Brady-Giglio it wouldn’t matter because the U.S. Supreme Court rulings override any state law protecting privacy. The motion says any private data the office obtains will remain protected with confidential information not pertinent to the case redacted and not made publicly available. In the past, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office has fought against defendants seeking this same private police data, and Melius notes that discrepancy. She argues the defense request is individual and not legally the same as the Attorney’s Office making the same request. “Without any legal bases, the defendants were conducting a fishing expedition,” Melius writes. In those cases the data went to a judge for a review before being given to the defendant. That wrinkle is perhaps most telling for why the use of these motions is considered a new prosecutorial tactic in public accountability of police misconduct. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office is asking to perform investigative work that it has argued in the past the defense is not legally allowed to do. Whether or not the motion is granted is left to individual judges in the Fourth District to determine. Hennepin County Chief Judge Kerry W. Meyer said in a statement that, “Each case with a motion is reviewed on the merits. The judge assesses whether there is disclosable information relevant in the case. The orders speak for themselves about the process used in the cases.” The motion for a Brady-Giglio review commonly asks the court to order a law enforcement agency — for example, the Minnesota State Patrol or Minneapolis Police Department Internal Affairs — to share disciplinary information against specific officers. If the judge grants the motion, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office reviews and catalogues the data and gives any information they view as relevant to the judge overseeing the case. The judge then performs what is known as an “in camera” review of the information to determine if it should be shared with the defense. In the case of the state troopers, Judge Tamara Garcia denied the motion “for lack of a plausible showing such files would contain material evidence.” She cites the Minnesota Supreme Court opinion in State v. Hummel which stated, “having the trial court review confidential material is not a right. It is a discovery option, but only after certain prerequisites are satisfied.” In other cases, judges have approved the motion and ordered the law enforcement agencies to produce specific disciplinary files for review. The sheer volume of motions the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office has filed indicates this is becoming standard operating procedure for a department that works with more than 35 law enforcement agencies to prosecute criminals. The reason for that could be related to gray areas in how different agencies categorize public vs. private police data. The Minneapolis Police Department has a publicly available “police discipline decision dashboard” which dates back more than a decade and tracks various violations and types of discipline. But, as the Star Tribune reported earlier this year, MPD has used coaching — a form of one-on-one mentoring — as their most common approach to dealing with police complaints in the past decade. Coaching documents are not publicly available. The ability of law enforcement agencies to make disciplinary actions private matters because they can argue that an employee could sue them if they share private data. These legal motions are one way the Attorney’s Office can work around that concern. When the county filed a Brady-Giglio motion in a murder trial earlier this year, Judge Juan Hoyos agreed to the motion. He ordered that Minneapolis Police Department Internal Affairs and the Office of Police Conduct Review provide the HCAO with “all not public data” relating to three officers who were potential witnesses in the trial. The HCAO would not be given any records against the officers that were designated either “Dismissed — No Basis” or “Exonerated.” Any other disciplinary files the HCAO would review, redact accordingly and provide any information they believe was needed to satisfy their Brady-Giglio obligation to Judge Hoyos. He would then decide if any of it needed to be shared with the defendant. The private data was held under a protective order by the court and the officers had to be alerted that their file was being provided to the state. The officers and the government agencies were given five business days to object. Staff writers Andy Mannix and Liz Sawyer contributed to this report.",

It’s awfully quiet out there for early October, with summer warmth spilling deep into autumn. Again. The first freeze (32 degrees F) at MSP usually comes on Oct. 11, but this year it may be two weeks late. We are locked into a sunny, dry, unusually mild pattern for most of October. November may be a rude awakening; we’ll see. After low 80s Saturday we cool off Sunday as winds gust to 35 mph. All these swings in temperature will whip up strong winds in the coming weeks, drying out our soil even faster. Moderate drought is creeping back into the state. Stating the obvious, we need rain.

        "input": "Headline: He was the face of addiction recovery. Then he got hooked on opioids.\nText: Viewers of “Dopesick,” a 2021 TV miniseries drama about the damage wrought by opioid addiction, may recall that even the well-meaning small-town doctor who prescribed OxyContin to his patients without realizing its dangers eventually gets hooked himself. If there’s anyone harder than that doctor to imagine succumbing to opioids’ addictive powers it might be William Cope Moyers, a “public face” of addiction and recovery. Moyers, who is 65 and lives in St. Paul, is a vice president at Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, the nationally known treatment organization based in Center City, Minn. (He’s also the son of longtime journalist and political commentator Bill Moyers.) He gives public talks, is contacted often by people seeking help with their dependency and has written books on the subject. Best known is 2007′s bestselling “Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption,” an account of his alcohol and cocaine addiction. The book follows his several recovery attempts before eventually achieving sobriety in 1994. So nobody, including Moyers, expected him to get addicted to a new substance almost 20 years later. How that addiction happened and how he overcame it is the subject of his new book, “Broken Open: What Painkillers Taught Me About Life and Recovery.” He tells about being prescribed Percocet when undergoing a series of grueling dental procedures. The pills relieved his pain — and more. “I could feel the pain evaporate, picturing tender wisps rising above my body to dissipate like smoke in the air of the dim room,” Moyers writes. “I felt easy, warm, content, happy, complete. I was smiling again. I may even have whispered out loud, ‘Life is good.’” Moyers talked to the Star Tribune about his journey, including why people should not feel shame about “relapsing” and why a drug that eliminates cravings should not be stigmatized in the recovery community. (His comments have been edited for length and clarity.) The St. Paul Downtown Rotary Club invited me to come and speak [in 1997, 10 years before the first book came out], because I was a Rotarian and they wanted to talk about alcoholism in the workplace. As I was speaking, I looked over that ballroom, and I was losing my audience. They were all falling asleep on me. I realized in that moment that if I was going to salvage my very first public talk, I’d better get personal. And it was on that day that I decided that I would tell my story. Those people did not know that I was recovering alcoholic and an addict. And when I told them that story, I woke them up. I was like, “Oh, that’s how you carry the message. That’s how you smash stigma. That’s how you promote treatment and recovery, by telling your story.” That’s how I became a public face for the organization. I was aware that I have an illness that is “cunning, baffling and powerful,” as we call it. And I also know it’s an illness that’s patient. It waits. But I had no desire to go back to the crack house. I had no desire to take a drink. I love my recovery. I owe my whole existence to it, and I’ve been pursuing recovery for more than half of my life. Why would I want to turn my back on that? So I had a healthy respect for the illness. I didn’t fear it because I can’t live my life in fear, but I knew from hearing other people’s stories that, you know, it’s always lurking. I was seen as a solid member of the recovery community; I had decades of recovery. I’m a public advocate. I work for Hazelden. I should have been more careful, but honestly, I was suffering [with pain from the dental procedure]. The epidemic was fueled by dentists and doctors who didn’t realize the power of oxycodone or Percocet or tramadol. And candidly, the doctors who knew me and were working on me, not only did they know who I was, but several of them were also experts on recovery with a personal perspective. So I’m not going to find any fault with them any more than I’m going to find any fault with me. I liked them because they took care of the pain. But I also liked them because they took the edge off. I had no desire to escape reality by going to the crack house. I had no desire to take a drink because I knew that my history with alcohol was not good. But the pain meds were clean. They were easy. They were legal. I’d had a pretty rocky period in there where my marriage fell apart. I became a single dad of three busy children. I had a 60-hour-a-week job. I had a lot of stuff going on. And they worked in terms of just taking the edge off the sharpness of my life. One of the “truisms” in the recovery community is “a drug is a drug is a drug.” It doesn’t matter when it comes to our relationship with addictive substances, a drug is a drug is a drug. That’s not true. Opiates are drug of a different beast. They play on the mind in a way that’s very different than any other thing I’d ever experienced. You crave them beyond anything you can imagine. And it’s why so many people that develop dependency end up scoring heroin on the street or taking a pill that they don’t know what’s in it. And that’s why there’s so many deaths. Suboxone was like a magic bullet. I was like “Oh, OK, I’m done, yeah.” Now I know that in my own addiction and in my own recovery, that there’s more to it than just taking a pill or medication, that there are other aspects of my illness that I need to address, which is why I had a basket of resources. I had the medication, yes, but I also had my faith. I had [the 12] steps. I had a lot of what I call recovery capital and those things were just as important as the medication. It’s just that the medication was important because it allowed me to clear my head, literally and figuratively. Opiates are different, especially for this addict and alcoholic.  I was sort of fascinated by that dynamic within, which was like, “Well, why can’t I just do this the way I did it with crack cocaine and alcohol? Shame on me. Why can’t I go to my step meeting and get the answer?” It was baffling to me because I had decades of sobriety at that point. And yet, I’m just as addicted as anybody else would be. And it’s like, “Wait a minute. What’s going on here?” I would share that in meetings, and people would be like, “Well, you’ve just got to get on your knees and pray hard,” or “You’ve got to go to more meetings” or “You’ve got to go for a walk around the lake.” And I was like, “Man, I’ve been doing that, and it’s not working.” It was also why I had so much shame around it. Because I was like, “Come on, man, what’s wrong with you? Why can’t you pull out of this dive, like you’ve pulled out of dives before?” Relapse has been terribly stigmatized. It’s such a shaming term because it suggests failure. If you relapse, you are expected to start over again. And I was like, “Start over again? I’m not going to start over again.” We don’t tell women with breast cancer who’ve had five years of remission, that when the disease of breast cancer comes back that, “Well, darn, that was a waste of time.” So I couldn’t call it a relapse because that’s not what it was to me. The book as I’ve written it is my story, as a man in long-term recovery who had this experience and what it means to me. I hope it gives people permission to understand that they, too, are not only human, but that they, too, can have a return to use and not throw everything away, not give up, not be cloaked in shame. That’s the messages of the book.",

        "input": "Headline: Tolkkinen: This ladybug look-alike has become the scourge of my autumns\nText: CLITHERALL, Minn. – Minnesota has a significant milestone this year that nobody is really talking about: the first official sighting of the Asian lady beetle in our state. It was 1994, 30 years ago, when scientist John Luhman was making his way into the entomology building on the University of Minnesota’s St. Paul campus and noticed an unusual beetle clinging to the brick. “It wasn’t any of my usual suspects because it was too large and had too many spots, and it was the wrong color,” said Luhman, who, as a biocontrol specialist and insect taxonomist, was possibly the best person to encounter it. “Right away, I knew it was something new.” He carried it into the building and soon identified it as Harmonia axyridis, or the Asian lady beetle, an invasive species that had been brought from Asia to the U.S. in the late 1970s or early 1980s to protect Georgia pecan trees from aphids. In Minnesota, it consumed the larvae of native ladybugs, and the native species’ numbers dwindled, said Luhman, who is now retired. If you live in a big city surrounded by homes and offices, you might not notice the Asian lady beetle. But in many rural parts of the state, it has become a scourge. My own introduction to the Asian lady beetle was in 2012 after returning home to our Otter Tail County farmhouse with our newborn son and a fresh C-section scar. There must have been tens of thousands of them in our house that winter. As I lay on the couch with our baby that first night, my mother-in-law and my husband vacuumed up as many as they could from ceilings and walls and furniture. By the next night, others had replaced them. As soon as I healed, I began vacuuming like a warrior queen, sucking up hundreds of them every morning and hundreds more every night. Still, they would race around our light fixtures, leaving a brownish trail, congregate by the water faucets, hide under the dish drain and behind pictures on the wall. They can be found in greater Minnesota wherever soybean fields are found. They’re great for farmers and gardeners because they eat the aphids that damage plants and reduce yields. But many a beautiful fall walk has been ruined by drifting clouds of the beetles landing on your hair and glasses, and sometimes delivering what feels like a bite. It’s actually not, Luhman said. They want to drink the moisture from your skin, but their sharp proboscis gets in the way and pokes you like a teensy ice pick. They don’t tend to swarm on cloudy, cool days, just the last lovely, sunny days of autumn, exactly when Otter Tail County visitors want to climb Inspiration Peak to view the fall colors or go on a peaceful hike. Some people in greater Minnesota might never notice them. Kelsey Hill, office manager for Detroit Lakes Pest Control, said she doesn’t see Asian lady beetles south of Detroit Lakes, where she lives, but they’re bad in nearby Frazee. Bridget Dawley, office manager for pest control company IPC, said she might see only one or two Asian lady beetles in her downtown Mankato office, but the area around New Richland, Ellendale, Heartland, New Ulm and Sleepy Eye gets inundated. “It’s rural, really, is what it is,” she said. “When you’re surrounded by cornfields or soybean fields, they’re going to cover your house where the sun shines.” Asian lady beetles are considered biological controls, a fancy way of saying organisms brought in to control undesirable organisms, such as aphids. When the Asian lady beetle was introduced, it was easier to bring biological controls into the U.S. than it is today, said University of Minnesota entomologist Bill Hutchison. Partly because of debacles like the Asian lady beetle, the federal government began changing its policies about 15 to 20 years ago, he said, requiring new species to undergo up to a decade of testing to prevent unintended consequences. “They’ve made it much more difficult to actually bring in new species,” he said. “So that is a change that’s occurred for the better.” The Asian lady beetle would never have passed the new standards, he said. Asian lady beetles save farmers from using as much pesticide, but those costs, and toxicity, have transferred to everyone who hires a company to spray their house each fall. So, 30 years, Asian lady beetles! Let’s strike up the oompah band! Or at least the out-of-tune trombones.",

        "input": "Headline: Looking for a great fall hike in Minnesota? We've got you covered. Here are 10 favorites.\nText: With the air crisp, bugs down and Minnesota’s natural beauty in stark relief, autumn is without a doubt the best time to hit the state’s many hiking trails. Minnesota has all kinds of terrain to suit anyone’s desires: boreal forests, prairies, river bluffs and wetlands, to name a few. So we asked state and regional parks insiders to suggest their favorite trails. Then, we narrowed the list to 10 and categorized them to help you find your perfect hike. One in the metro is a good path for families looking to explore while keeping young brains interested. In northern Minnesota, another is remote and, perhaps, underappreciated. All are rich in their own way – and all are waiting to be explored. Blue Mounds State Park, Luverne Great for: A choose-your-own adventure Location: Hwy. 75, 5 miles north of I-90 Directions to trailhead: The trail starts at the western end of the picnic area parking lot, a half-mile past the main entrance. Distance: Two miles one way, with options to make 1, 2, and 4 ½-mile loops on other trails. Surface: Mowed prairie with intermittent rocky areas. Difficulty: Easy Admission: Annual state parks vehicle permit ($35) or daily permit ($7). What to expect: Park Naturalist Tiffany Muellner said the trail is perfect for visitors to create their own adventures. The hike can be lengthened or shortened with connector trails to the Lower Cliffline Trail (with views from below of an old quartzite quarry) or to the Mound Trail (with sweeping prairie views). Muellner reminds hikers to be prepared for any weather, hot or chilly or wet: “The prairie is by nature an extreme and exposed environment.” Lucky trekkers might get a good look at the park’s resident herd of nearly 100 bison. Map and park information: bit.ly/parkbluemounds Glendalough State Park, Battle Lake Great for: Prairie views Location: 3 miles northeast of Battle Lake on Hwy. 16 Directions to trailhead: Follow signs to the Sunset Lake Trail parking lot, 1 ½ miles from the park entrance Distance: One-mile loop, with option to extend on the Savanna Trail Surface: Grass Difficulty: Moderately hilly Admission: Annual state parks vehicle permit ($35) or daily permit ($7). What to expect: Park Manager Jeff Wiersma said prairie grasses and wildflowers will peak by mid-September along with the bright red of sumacs. Red oaks on the lakeshore will soon follow. Wiersma said visitors should consider extending shorter days by taking in a sunset across the lake and, on a clear night, a panorama of stars. Map and park information: bit.ly/parkglenda Elm Creek Park Reserve, Dayton Great for: Family friendly options Location: Northwest metro between Hwy. 169 and I-94 Directions to trailhead: Numerous trails can be accessed from the nature center Difficulty: Easy to moderate Surface: Dirt and paved Distance: Varies from half-mile to 1 ½ miles, out and back Admission: Free What to expect: Three Rivers Parks District Wildlife Biologist Angela Grill is quick to recommend the trails, which are accessed from the center’s main facility. “This is a great place to begin an outdoor journey at any season,” she said, with hikes of varying lengths, on different surfaces and through diverse habitats. Located in the floodplain of Rush Creek, the forest dominated by sugar maples is sure to produce a striking autumn in transition. Kids will love the floating boardwalk and fort-building in the nature exploration area. The center staff recommends the half-mile Oxbow Loop. “Don’t be surprised if you easily spend three hours exploring all this site has to offer,” she said. Map and park information: bit.ly/parkeastman Tettegouche State Park, Silver Bay Great for: Vistas of inland lakes and Lake Superior Location: Hwy. 61, just south of Hwy. 1 toward Finland Directions to trailhead: The trail starts at the Trail Center parking lot, 1.2 miles from the park entrance. Distance: About 5.6 miles, out and back Surface: Dirt, rocks and roots Difficulty: Moderate to difficult Admission: Annual state parks vehicle permit ($35) or daily permit ($7). What to expect: Consider this an alternative to the popular Bean and Bear lakes portion of the Superior Hiking Trail. The payoff for getting to Mount Trudee’s overlooks are views worth soaking in: a panorama that includes the tops of trees, inland lakes and the deep blue of Lake Superior. The hike and climb is steady but worth it, said Annie Nelson, a trail guidebook writer and the association’s communications director. While the association welcomes — and wants — the public’s interest in specific locations like Bean and Bear in Silver Bay, Nelson said it’s good to think about other possibilities. “The interest is wonderful in all sorts of ways to find these places,” she said, “but the flip side is it condenses us all, and that can have an impact. There are hundreds of equally beautiful spots along the trail.” Map and information: bit.ly/parktrudee; shta.org Frontenac State Park, Frontenac Great for: An excellent workout Location: 16 miles southeast of Red Wing on Hwy. 61 Directions to trailhead: The trail starts behind the kiosk at the picnic area, 2 miles from the park entrance. Distance: 2.7 mile loop with 700 feet of overall elevation Surface: Dirt/paved Difficulty: Moderate/difficult Admission: Annual state parks vehicle permit ($35) or daily permit ($7). What to expect: Park Manager Jake Gasterrecommended this hike for its gorgeous overlooks of Lake Pepin and the Mississippi River Valley. “The park packs a lot of diversity into a small area,” Gaster said, citing its prairies, wet meadow, riparian forest and oak savanna. What else to know: If a hike up a steep bluff is a barrier, consider the Sand Point Trail that will take you on a three-quarter mile walk to the shores of Lake Pepin, Gaster said. Map and park information: bit.ly/parkfrotenac Grand Portage State Park, Grand Portage Great for: A view of the state’s tallest waterfall Location: 40 miles northeast of Grand Marais via Hwy. 61 Directions to trailhead: The park is a combination state park and highway rest area. The trail starts from the rest area parking lots, just a few hundred feet from the park entrance. Distance: 1.2 miles out and back Surface: Paved/boardwalk Difficulty: Easy Admission: Free. State park vehicle permits are not required at Grand Portage. What to expect: The trail is the gateway to viewing Minnesota’s tallest waterfall at 120 feet. There are options to walk through or around the visitor center, and the trail meanders northwest along the Pigeon River. A 700-foot boardwalk provides easy access on the last section of the trail leading up to the falls, where there are three viewing platforms (one wheelchair accessible). What else to know: Also worth considering is a visit south to the Grand Portage National Monument south of the park, where a visitor center and reconstructed fort help tell the fur trade history of the area, and where there are also walking trails with exceptional views of Grand Portage Bay and Lake Superior, said park manager Travis Novitsky. Map and park information: bit.ly/parkgrand Fort Snelling State Park, St. Paul Great for: Nature in the city Location: Off Hwy. 5 and Post Road Directions to trailhead: Park at the Thomas C. Savage parking lot within the park Distance: Two miles one-way to Minnehaha Falls. Surface: Newly paved in 2023 Difficulty: Easy (mainly flat) Admission: Annual state parks vehicle permit ($35) or daily permit ($7). What to expect: The trail goes past the site of the concentration camp where thousands of Dakota people were moved during the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, and winds below Historic Fort Snelling. The trail, at mid-bluff along the Mississippi River, continues upriver toward Minnehaha Falls, adjacent to Coldwater Spring, a National Parks Service unit, and an off-leash dog park managed by Minneapolis Parks. The location is part of the Mississippi Flyway bird migration route, so expect to see numerous bird species, said Park nNaturalist Kao Thao. Be aware the trail is multi-use, with cyclists, runners and walkers. Map and park information: bit.ly/parksnelling La Salle Lake State Recreation Area, Solway Great for: Rugged adventure Location: Off Hwy. 9, 40 miles north of Park Rapids Directions to trailhead: To begin the hike, park in the picnic area parking lot and walk east past the picnic shelter, fishing pier and boat launch toward trail intersection E. Starting the hike from this direction avoids a 2-mile trek back to the parking lot. Distance: 6 ½-mile loop Surface: Packed dirt, grass, water crossings Difficulty: Difficult due to remote location, hilly terrain, rugged trail conditions and unpredictable water crossings Admission: Annual state parks vehicle permit ($35) or daily permit ($7). What to expect: The Challenge Trail should be regarded as a wilderness experience, said Itasca State Park’s Heather Funk, a park ranger. The area contains and protects numerous rare species of plants, like the ram’s head lady slipper, and special species of concern, like the trumpeter swan. The trail encircles La Salle Lake, considered one of Minnesota’s deepest natural inland lakes at 213 feet. Worth noting: Cell phone reception ranges from poor to none, and hunting and trapping are allowed a various times in the fall. Funk suggested visitors download the Avenza Maps app and download the recreation area’s map, which tracks location even off grid. What else to know: Don’t forget essentials, like hydration and a first aid kit. Funk suggested allowing four to six hours to complete the hike, which passes through “a colorful forest of maples, oaks, aspens, birch, and basswood mixed with the enduring green of towering pines and spruce trees.” Map and recreation area information: bit.ly/reclasalle Camden State Park, Lynd Great for: A little bit of everything, including maple stands, prairies and a river overlook Location: Hwy. 23, about 7 miles southwest of Marshall Directions to trailhead: Follow signs to the swimming pond parking lot from the park entrance Distance: 2.2 miles Surface: Dirt/mowed grass Difficulty: Moderate (sturdy footwear encouraged) Admission: Annual state parks vehicle permit ($35) or daily permit ($7). What to expect: The hike begins in a wooded valley and follows a creek uphill through basswood, oak and maple stands. Hikers emerge at an overlook with great views along the Redwood River. The path continues through prairie and returns to the valley. Parks and Trails Associate Hannah Buysse calls it “the best parts of fall in one beautiful loop.” What else to know: An all-terrain wheelchair is available for free checkout and can access most trails. Call the park office at 507-872-7031 to reserve it. Map and park information: bit.ly/parkcamden Great River Bluffs State Park, Winona Great for: Mississippi River views Location: 15 miles southeast of Winona on Hwy. 61 Directions to trailhead: The trail starts at the campground visitor parking lot just outside the campground. Distance: One mile out and back Surface: Dirt Difficulty: Easy Admission: Annual state parks vehicle permit ($35) or daily permit ($7). What to expect: The flat trail courses through a hardwood forest, ending at an overlook of the Mississippi River Valley — a prime spot to see fall’s transformation, said Natural Resources Specialist Levi Thesing. The overlook sits on a bluff prairie teeming with a diversity of flowers. What else to know: Looking for other options of varying distances in the park’s 7 miles of trail? Consider King’s Bluff Trail and the North Overlook. Map and park information: bit.ly/parkgreat",

He peered at eight wall-mounted television monitors and switched from wide shots to dramatic close-ups, beaming this service to all of Eagle Brook’s statewide campuses. “Six, then nine on drop. Take six. Go ahead nine. Very nice!” It was 11 a.m. sharp, the second of two Sunday services on a recent weekend at Minnesota’s largest church. The bandleader kicked things off in an understated way: “Hey everybody, welcome to church.” He launched into Christian rock songs whose lyrics were projected on two huge screens in this packed auditorium: plenty of Vikings jerseys, many of the 2,000 parishioners holding a cup of Eagle Brook blend coffee from the church’s Starbucks-esque cafe. As the lead pastor of this campus spoke about finding community in this massive church, a clock in back ticked down to zero, ensuring all the campuses and online hosts stuck to the same schedule. Then Ted Cunningham, an author, comedian, pastor of a Missouri church and member of Eagle Brook’s teaching team, took the stage. The leaders of Minnesota’s largest church don’t love the word “megachurch.” That comes with too many connotations: too politicized, too business-like, too impersonal. “I don’t like it at all,” senior pastor Jason Strand said in an interview. “The minute people label us ‘megachurch,’ there’s all sorts of thoughts and baggage comes with that.” Eagle Brook prefers “multi-site church.” As Cunningham preached about time management, a message about centering God in our lives, his image beamed to a dozen more sites across Minnesota. Eagle Brook’s numbers are mind-boggling. As American church attendance declines — 30% of Americans attend religious services weekly or nearly every week, according to a Gallup survey, down from 42% two decades ago — this Baptist-affiliated church has become one of America’s largest and fastest-growing churches. An average Eagle Brook weekend has about 25,000 people worshiping in person. The 13th Minnesota location opened in September in Baxter, near Brainerd, and a 14th opens in Red Wing this weekend. In Rochester on a recent Sunday, where services are conducted at the Mayo Civic Center until the church raises money for a northwest Rochester expansion on land it purchased for $600,000, the Lino Lakes sermon was simulcast to more than 100 people. At the new outpost near Brainerd, hundreds packed inside. Another 27,000 devices tune in online, individuals at home as well as nearly 50 larger viewing groups across Minnesota as well as in New York, Arizona and Florida. The church streams services in 19 correctional facilities in Minnesota. The Wright County Jail had 42 inmates for a recent viewing group; a home in Hancock, a west-central Minnesota town of fewer than 1,000 people, regularly sees 40 people. Eagle Brook has 261 full-time employees, a $53 million budget and an expansion fund of $10 million this year. Its 2024 annual report records the impact: 9,184 decisions to follow Jesus, 2,249 baptisms, 2,798 families contributing more than $5,000 to its general fund. Services are efficient, the product is consistent at all locations, and it operates without debt, never building a campus until it is fully paid for. The growth rankles some. Some online commenters deride it as a “concert and coffee shop” vibe. Plenty criticize the church for catering to a well-off, white, suburban clientele. The church dropped a proposal to build a 60,000-square-foot church in Minnetonka in 2022 after neighbors pushed back. The Plymouth City Council this year reversed its decision to deny a new 64,000-square-foot building after the church threatened a lawsuit. Yet according to Strand, a 45-year-old father of five raised in the Twin Cities suburbs never attending church, becoming so big was never some grand plan. The plan is simply to remove barriers to entry and bring people to Christ. That comes out in many ways: focusing on core Christian beliefs without being drawn into today’s divisive politics, or devoting nights to groups on grief or divorce or addiction. It’s why this Sunday’s Scripture-laden sermon on time management for busy parents is really about maximizing our time on earth, while the next Sunday’s sermon on generosity is really about happiness coming not from consuming but from giving.

        "input": "Headline: Pilot program giving Minnesota artists guaranteed income extended to five years\nText: A pilot program providing a basic income for Minnesota artists was one of the first. Soon, it’ll become one of the longest. Springboard for the Arts announced Tuesday that it is extending and expanding its guaranteed income program. Not only is it giving artists five years of $500 monthly payments, it is adding 25 new rural artists to its roster. By January, 100 artists in Minnesota will receive the no-strings-attached sums. In doing so, they’ll be participating in a growing local, national and international experiment. Springboard was one of the first organizations to focus on creatives whose work is often precarious and whose income is often inconsistent. A nonprofit with offices in St. Paul and Fergus Falls, it is now adding more rural artists, making them a focus of ongoing research into how these payments make a difference for  people and communities. For Torri Hanna, being a fiber artist meant juggling — the grant applications, the second job, making the scarves that pay versus the fiber art pieces that sometimes don’t. Then, in 2023, Hanna received an unexpected email that made her cry with relief: $500 a month, no application required. “This is the first time I’ve really felt supported as an artist,” said Hanna, 64, who lives in Fergus Falls. Some months, the $500 helped Hanna buy groceries. Other months, it allowed her to pay down credit cards. After a run-in with a deer, it helped her afford a used car. Over time, it gave her the opportunity to buy a cute, old Victorian house with her daughter. “It gives me a cushion,” said Hanna, who also owns a yarn store in town. “There’s the car payment, electric, gas, insurance for the car and the house. I’m not going out and partying with it, that’s for darn sure.” St. Paul is among the cities that have tried sending money to very low-income residents, studying the results. When Springboard launched its project in 2021, it was one of the nation’s first guaranteed income programs aimed at artists. “It’s not because we think artists are more deserving or more worthy than anyone else,” said Laura Zabel, Springboard’s executive director. Creative work is one form of labor that, like caregiving, “our economy doesn’t value” but that communities need — now more than ever, she said. “I love thinking about guaranteed income as a way of honoring that we all have contributions to make to our community, and we need a little bit of time and space and breathing room to make those contributions,” Zabel said. A similar experiment also started in 2021 in San Francisco, run by the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, has ended. In 2022, the Creatives Rebuild New York program began providing some 2,400 artists in New York with $1,000 per month for 18 months. That same year, Ireland’s government began providing 2,000 artists about $350 a week, or about $18,200 a year, as part of a three-year pilot program. Every 18 months, Springboard has extended its program’s funding. Now, it’s guaranteeing artists five years of income. The first 25 participants, who have received income since 2021, will see that money continue for two more years. Those who started receiving it 18 months ago, including 25 artists in Otter Tail County, will continue. And the 25 new recipients there will begin the program knowing they’ll get money for five years. “So, from a research perspective, that’s very exciting — to be able to research and understand some of the difference between folks who know from the beginning the longer time horizon,” Zabel said, “and what that allows them to do in terms of planning and commitment to their community.” Springboard’s work, broadly, is focused on place, she continued, so the nonprofit wants to see how this guaranteed income might affect artists’ ability “to stay in a place and contribute to a place and feel like that place that loves them back. For rural places, especially … that’s a huge part of the picture of how we build more resilient and healthier local economies, is people feeling like someone wants them to be there and values their contributions.” The 75 artists have received $675,000 on prepaid debit cards, according to the Guaranteed Income Pilots Dashboard, a partnership of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research, Stanford Basic Income Lab and Mayors for a Guaranteed Income. Funding has come from private foundations, at first from the Bush Foundation, then the Kresge and Ford foundations and now the McKnight Foundation, Zabel said. Springboard is also putting its own general operating funds into the project. The guaranteed income pilot has “reshaped their relationship to their art,” removing some of the hustle, said Kalen Flynn, qualitative data scientist with the Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s allowed them the space to feel connected to their art again and create what they want to create without the pressure of, ‘It has to sell.’” Flynn has led the research on Springboard’s pilot, interviewing participants in St. Paul and Otter Tail County. She appreciates that it includes rural participants because “there is this idea that guaranteed income is only a solution to urban poverty.” But rural artists share many of the same struggles, including housing. This will be the longest-lasting pilot Flynn has worked on and “one of the longest in the country.” While the fact that Springboard’s project keeps being extended has been exciting for participants, the uncertainty of its renewal “also recreates the precarity of the economic market,” Flynn said, “I’m interested to see if knowing you’ll have it for five years at the onset makes a difference in how people think about stability in community, their ties to their place, that relational aspect. And also, how it impacts how they think about their own goals.” Hanna ended up in Fergus Falls in 2018 because of Springboard. Newly divorced, the then-southwestern Minnesota resident was scouting the state in search of a medium-sized city where an artist could afford to make a home. She saw that Springboard had a Fergus Falls office and called them up. She’d never been to Fergus Falls and arrived in January, when the temperature was 5 degrees below zero. “The snow was whistling through the streets,” she said, “and I just loved it.” Hanna opened her Tangles to Treasures shop downtown, then moved to a little mall that was more accessible for her mother, for whom she was a caregiver. The $500 a month helped her make that move, among others. And, importantly, it has given her a bit of time to make art. One of those pieces is a part of an exhibition at Springboard titled “Exhale,” with works artists created about the guaranteed income program. Hanna hand-wove copper wire into a delicate-but-strong screen, then needle felted little images representing what the payments have meant to her. A bank, representing her improved credit. Three figures, representing three generations. A house, the one she and her daughter now share. “Having the guaranteed income ... allows a little grace to create whatever needs creating,” she said, “whether it’s a safe space for your mother or a work of art for a show.”",

Minnesota’s largest nonprofit health insurer on Tuesday announced the funding commitment for the clinic, which will open this year and provide in-person mental health care for eight counties surrounding Mankato. South-central Minnesota has been federally listed since 2022 as lacking mental health professionals. “Geography should not be a barrier to accessing mental and behavioral health services,” said Brett Hart, vice president of behavioral health and mental health parity for Eagan-based Blue Cross. “Far too often, especially in greater Minnesota, mental health needs far exceed available resources.” Depression and anxiety have been rising problems in Minnesota, particularly in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 24% of Minnesota adults were told in 2022 that they have a form of depression, according to federal survey results, which is an increase from 18% a decade earlier. Mankato and surrounding Blue Earth County have one of the highest poverty rates in Minnesota, which can exacerbate mental health struggles. Minnesota’s depression rate was 43% in 2022 for adults in low-income households. Blue Cross’ investment is in partnership with Minnesota State University, Mankato, and its College of Allied Health and Nursing. The college will rotate students to the clinic so they can put their training into practice under the supervision of faculty and licensed professionals. “There are no other academic training clinics in the state that are also specifically focused on providing integrated outpatient mental health services to rural Minnesotans,” said Edward Inch, the university’s president. The Minnesota Legislature also allocated $1.5 million in 2023 for the clinic, which will provide mental health counseling and medication management to patients of all ages, regardless of their insurance status. The clinic will be adjacent to the university campus and will eventually expand to provide virtual therapy appointments as well as psycho-educational evaluations and counseling for substance use disorders. “A clinic like this is not an easy thing to get off the ground or to maintain,” Hart said. “Ultimately, we anticipate that the clinic will be self-sustaining, but we know it can sometimes take several years to get to that point.” The investment is Blue Cross’ third in partnership with the university in Mankato to increase access to mental health care and increase career pathways in health care for students.",

After a discussion lasting more than two hours, the council unanimously decided to postpone any vote until its Oct. 22 meeting. Several council members said they were conflicted about approving the request for the project when St. Anthony has a “dearth” of affordable housing and stated a desire to preserve the property for such a use. “We want to continue to be a welcoming place,” said Mayor Wendy Webster. “We also need housing that’s available to differing incomes.” The Tibyan Center bought the former Bremer Bank property on the 2400 block of Lowry Avenue NE. with plans to renovate the building. The site once had been slated to become a 76-unit housing project, but it did not move forward, according to a memo on Tuesday’s City Council agenda and packet. St. Anthony’s Planning Commission approved the Tibyan request, though some residents expressed concerns about traffic and parking needs. The city’s zoning ordinance allows for religious assemblies on the property. Since May, when the Tibyan Center’s plans became known, vandals struck at least eight times and did significant damage. Thieves also stole computers and other items. But the center is still planning to open once the city gives its final approval.",

        "input": "Headline: Lino Lakes council censures member for applauding anti-Muslim email\nText: The Lino Lakes City Council voted Monday night to censure one of its members for applauding an anti-Muslim email that called Islam “our declared enemy” in response to a news article about a proposed housing development that includes a mosque. Wearing an American flag necktie and at one point holding up a copy of the Quran, Council Member Chris Lyden objected to the resolution to censure him, calling the issue “so trivial.” “There’s never a good time to sell your soul attempting to be politically correct,” he said near the start of his objections that lasted about 10 minutes. In the end, the City Council voted 3-1 to censure Lyden. Council Member Michael Ruhland was the lone no vote, and Lyden did not participate in the vote. The censure distances the city from Lyden’s response, which the resolution says “could be interpreted by some” as endorsing anti-Muslim opinions in the original email. “The response neither reflects the views of the City or the views of the City Council,” the resolution reads. “The Council disavows the email response in its entirety.” On Aug. 4, a person writing as “Sean, USA” sent Lyden a lengthy email about a New York Times story on the controversial Madinah Lakes development proposal. The development would bring a “Muslim-friendly” housing development to Lino Lakes that includes a mosque. The housing component recently stalled when the City Council enacted a one-year moratorium on residential developments. The emailer sent the anti-Muslim letter to the story’s author, to Lyden and to members of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). The email claimed there was “no such thing” as Islamophobia. Lyden responded using his city email account, writing, “Might be the best email I have ever received!” CAIR demanded Lyden resign for the response, which the organization said was endorsing Islamophobia. Lyden rejected the allegations of racism and said he takes issue “with the CAIR organization. Period.” Although Ruhland voted against the resolution, he said that was in order to continue working on it, and that he took issue with Lyden using his city email to respond. “My biggest issue is I feel he violated the code of conduct by handling personal opinions and personal business matters with city resources,” Ruhland said. The resolution to censure Lyden was brought forward by Mayor Rob Rafferty and Council Member Dale Stoesz, the agenda packet indicates. The Madinah Lakes project, which was recently stalled, has drawn backlash from some city residents who say it would overburden the town’s infrastructure, including its water supply, and that it would diminish Lino Lakes’ small-town feel. The opponents have also raised concerns about the 2013 theft-by-swindle conviction on the record for the project’s developer Faraaz Yussuf, whose official name is Faraaz Mohammed. Many others, including members of the Muslim community from Blaine and elsewhere, have come out in support of the project, and say the opposition is rooted in Islamophobia. Jaylani Hussein, CAIR-MN’s executive director, continued to argue that Lyden should resign. “You need to resign, and the rest of you need to hold him accountable,” Hussein said.",

        "input": "Headline: Talking trash in Minnesota: Is it better to burn or bury garbage that can’t be recycled?\nText: Red Wing and Minneapolis are just 60 miles apart, but they have very different attitudes about whether it’s better to burn or bury trash that can’t be recycled. In Minneapolis, residents and activists fought for years to shutter the Hennepin County Energy Recovery Center (HERC), a trash incinerator on the edge of downtown Minneapolis. They argue it contributes to the high rate of respiratory diseases and air pollution in nearby communities that are primarily home to low-income residents of color — and last year, state leaders and local officials agreed they need a timeline to shut it down. However, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s (MPCA) current policy says it’s better to burn garbage that can’t be recycled or composted rather than send it to one of the state’s 21 open landfills. And in Red Wing, Mayor Mike Wilson thinks the Xcel Energy incinerator just outside of town is an asset. It takes processed trash from Ramsey and Washington counties and burns it to create electricity. “I think we’re fortunate, because ... I look at the Burnsville [Sanitary Landfill] and these other facilities that have got these piles and piles and piles of garbage there. Explain to me what they’re going to do with that,” Wilson said. “You’ve got to get rid of it.” Outside of the HERC, none of the state’s six other waste-to-energy incinerators, which are not in such densely populated areas, face immediate pressure to close down. But at least one  operator acknowledged they’ve been told to find alternative ways to handle garbage once their next contract runs out. And as Minnesota reckons with its growing garbage problem and 2040 carbon-free energy goal, the question remains: Is it better to burn or bury the trash? It’s complicated, depending on how people weigh immediate impacts and future risks. Kirk Koudelka, an assistant commissioner at the MPCA, said state law and agency policy follow the Environmental Protection Agency’s waste hierarchy, which says burning trash to create energy is preferable to burying it in a landfill. Both disposal methods release greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, but incinerators have less of a long-term impact on the environment. Long after they’re closed, landfills produce methane gas and leachate — a liquid containing forever chemicals. “Landfilling not only has an environmental impact today, but even after it closes and stops accepting waste, it still has an environmental impact,” Koudelka said. In contrast, incinerator operators say they dramatically reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills by burning it to create electricity. They work to remove metals and other recyclables before combustion and can recover precious metals from the ash. Dave McNary, assistant director of the HERC, said more pollutants come from vehicle tailpipes than the HERC, which sends emissions through complex environmental controls before releasing them from a 200-foot smokestack. “The state has spent hundreds of millions of dollars cleaning up old landfills. They haven’t spent a dime cleaning up waste to energy,” McNary said. State officials note that most of the roughly $400 million spent on landfill clean-up is for older facilities without the latest liners and leachate controls. Opponents of incineration, like the local Zero Burn Coalition, argue the MPCA and EPA don’t account for the full impacts on health and the environment of burning garbage. They say modern landfills are a safer option as communities work to reduce the trash they generate. Mike Ewall, of the Energy Justice Network, said waste-to-energy is a misnomer and that incinerators are the most costly and polluting way to dispose of trash and create energy. Incinerators release greenhouse gases and other pollutants immediately rather than over time. Burning garbage also creates toxic chemicals like dioxins and furans. Questions remain about incinerator ash, which burn opponents contend is toxic but supporters argue is harmless. Plus, the incinerator effectively puts the growing garbage problem out of sight rather than encouraging people to create less waste, the opponents say. “Stop the incinerator,” said Gary Liss, of Zero Waste USA. “It’s time to focus our energy on the zero waste initiatives that everyone says they want to pursue.” Meanwhile, trash continues to pile up. Metro counties expect to see a 19% increase in waste by 2042. The MPCA determined in 2021 that the Twin Cities was running out of landfill space for household garbage and recommended several metro-area landfills expand. So far, the Burnsville Sanitary Landfill owned by Waste Management has a permit for expansion; Pine Bend Landfill in Inver Grove Heights and Dem-Con in Shakopee are going through the process to obtain permits. Minnesota and the country as a whole want to move away from landfills, but as long as we keep consuming and creating waste, it has to go somewhere, said Paige Novak, a University of Minnesota environmental engineering professor. Still, the leachate from landfills can be problematic and tough to manage, Novak said: “[It] has a lot of organic compounds in it, it can be really acidic, it can have heavy metals in it.” Landfills must be monitored in perpetuity for leaks and other issues, she said. Bloomington was among the loudest opponents of the Burnsville landfill’s expansion, noting it is partially unlined and sits within a 100-year flood plain, said Glen Markegard, Bloomington’s planning manager. The south metro suburb sends its trash to the HERC, and favors incineration over landfilling, Markegard said, because officials worry about landfills’ production of methane and the potential to contaminate ground and surface water. Dakota County is home to three landfills, including Pine Bend, the state’s largest open landfill, said County Commissioner Joe Atkins, who lives in Inver Grove Heights, and that isn’t always pleasant. “There’s stigma that comes with being home to a landfill ... whether you smell it or see it or experience the size of it,” he said But Atkins noted there are upsides, including the fees host cities and counties receive. Inver Grove Heights, for instance, got about $2.3 million in 2023 from Pine Bend, said Kris Wilson, city administrator. Melissa Quillard, a spokesperson from Republic Services, which operates Pine Bend, said, “Modern landfills are highly engineered with several environmental programs in place, including extensive liner, gas and liquid collection systems that are frequently monitored and inspected.” The methane landfills create can be used as fuel, Quillard said. The state’s first renewable natural gas plant was built recently at Pine Bend, collecting biogas and producing natural gas that goes into the Xcel pipeline. Activists, state experts and local leaders agree Minnesotans need to generate a lot less trash to reduce their reliance on landfills and incinerators. State and local officials are pushing to improve the metro’s 45% recycling rate and boost access to composting. They’re also advocating for new laws, like legislation passed this year requiring that all packaging be recyclable by 2032. There are bright spots on the horizon. The Legislature gave $5 million in 2024 to help create an anaerobic digester to turn food waste into renewable natural gas and biochar, which can be used for filtration or added to soil. That facility is in the MPCA permitting process. The future of waste-to-energy incinerators, however, is unclear. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission will decide how other incinerators will fit into the state’s goal of carbon-free energy by 2040. That worries Trista Martinson, executive director of Ramsey/Washington Recycling and Energy, which shreds garbage that’s burned by Xcel in Red Wing and Mankato to generate electricity. She fears the trash will end up in a landfill. “It will eventually leak, if not now in our generation, in the future generations, plus there’s not enough space,” she said. “If we take away that really important tool [of incineration] without something in its place, we’ve got a different, bigger problem.”",

        "input": "Headline: Minnesota election law changes since 2020 aim to boost turnout\nText: Some of the slew of laws passed in the 2023 legislative session are aimed at making it easier for eligible voters to cast ballots, and advocates hope that will mean Minnesota voters, who have voted at some of the highest rates in the country in recent elections, turn out in even higher numbers this year. With early voting now underway, Minnesota voters will start to see some of these new laws. Absentee voting has become more prevalent since the pandemic, and new laws expanding early in-person voting are in effect. Voters can still request mail-in absentee ballots for any reason — or no reason at all, under the state’s no-excuse absentee ballot law. Starting this year, voters can put themselves on a permanent absentee voter list, meaning they will get a ballot mailed to them for every election. “It can’t be any easier than voting from home,” said Michelle Witte, executive of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters Minnesota. During a news conference Thursday, Secretary of State Steve Simon suggested that people who plan to vote by mail budget at least a week to return their completed ballots. “We are seeing some delays nationally with the U.S. Postal Service,” Simon said, and added that he is particularly concerned about the proportion of mail that has lately been marked “undeliverable” when there was not any problem with the address. He wants to make sure people who request absentee ballots get those ballots with enough time to mail them back. Simon wants to see additional training and resources for the postal service. But, he said, the way the service handled the last presidential election gives him hope. “2020 was the ultimate stress test when it came to the mail and the number of people choosing to vote by mail,” Simon said. If the postal service was able to handle the flood of mailed-in ballots during the pandemic, he said, he’s confident there will not be major issues this November. Mail-in voting has not been as common since the 2020 election, Witte said. In-person early voting will also be easier this year with expanded weekend voting hours at early-voting locations. Witte said a legislative change will mean that people who vote up to 18 days before Election Day in-person will be able to put their ballots into a tabulator. Previously, only people who voted a week before Election Day could feed their ballots into the machines. She said that gives people more confidence their ballots will be counted. Since April, the Secretary of State’s Office reports more than 90,000 voters have been registered or pre-registered through the “automatic voter registration” system that signs people up to vote when they get drivers’ licenses. While Minnesota grants driver’s licenses to residents regardless of immigration status, officials say the ID requirements provide sufficient safeguards against illegal voting. “It’s really not automatic,” Witte said. “You do have to prove your citizenship.” Simon also noted expanded hours for in-person voting across the state, and tweaks to the automatic voter registration system that will make sure only eligible voters are registered. A lesser-known law change lets voters bring as many people as they want to the voting booth, removing an earlier three-person limit. Witte said she thought that would help first-time voters feel more confident about what they will encounter at a polling place. “It doesn’t have to be scary and isolated,” she said. Outside of early and absentee voting, Witte thinks one of the biggest changes to election laws is letting 16- and 17-year-olds who will be 18 by Election Day pre-register to vote. “That’s to me one of the most consequential laws that expands voter access,” Witte said. Voters 18 to 24 years old tend to vote less than older voters, she said, “but when they are registered, they vote near 90%.” Simon said he hopes Minnesota will have the nation’s highest rate of voter turnout again. But it will be a little harder this year, he said, because tens of thousands of people are newly eligible to vote. This year, some 57,000 people who have served prison sentences for felony convictions got their right to vote back after legislation in 2023. Witte said the League of Women Voters has been working to register those who have served their time to vote this year. The league has also been registering voters at the record-expungement events the Attorney General’s Office has put on for people with marijuana convictions. Witte said in addition to the 57,000 people with felony convictions who have left prison and are now eligible to vote, there are tens of thousands of others who have been involved in the justice system and are only now learning that they are eligible voters — and those people are starting to register, she said.",

The preliminary and brief probe of the lake’s subsurface, paid for by a $67,000 grant from Minnesota’s Clean Water Fund, didn’t dazzle organizers with findings of snowmobiles, docks, sunken boats, fishing shacks or automobiles. Rather, divers were surprised by the light loads of litter they found while exploring a sample of heavily fished holes, flats and reefs. “It’s looking remarkably cleaner than we thought it would,” said Colin West, founder and chief executive of nonprofit Clean Up the Lake. “We’re not seeing significant signs of a problem.’’ The group’s divers recovered fishing gear, tires, beer cans and a chrome hubcap from an old Buick. But the debris wasn’t in heavy concentrations like West has seen in other lakes, he said. His company’s initial inspection of Mille Lacs was spearheaded by Ann Brucciani Lyon, vice chair of the Mille Lacs Area Community Foundation and a member of Minnesota’s Keep It Clean Coalition. The coalition, now with volunteers from more than 50 lakes and soil and water conservation districts, successfully lobbied the Legislature in 2023 to tighten waste and garbage controls specific to ice fishing. “This is about taking a great lake that’s loved by a lot of people and making it better,’’ Lyon said. “It’s a starting point and I’m not sure what will happen next.’’ Regardless of what details are revealed in Clean Up the Lake’s upcoming summary report, Lyon said the project has boosted public awareness about the undeniable problem of submerged litter washing up on the shores of the 207-square-mile lake. Students from the Isle School District got involved, helping to sort debris pulled from the lake and the scuba team met with community members at a well-attended open house. Lyon said one purpose of the mission was to encourage more environmental stewardship. “This kind of data gathering helps to elevate our awareness of what’s in our lakes,’’ said Pat Murphy, president of Aitkin County Lakes and Rivers Association. “Water connects us all … this starts conversations.’’ Mille Lacs is the 13th lake and the first in the Upper Midwest to be examined by Clean Up the Lake, a small organization that made a name for itself in 2022 by pulling 25,000 pounds of trash from Lake Tahoe. The Nevada alpine lake is slightly smaller than Mille Lacs, but attracts far more people — up to 20 million visits a year. The primary sponsor of the Tahoe cleanup hired an artist to make a public sculpture out of the trash. West said diving in Mille Lacs is a world apart from working in the azure waters of Tahoe, where visibility ranges from 40 to 60 feet. In Mille Lacs, his divers could only see 3 to 4 feet, he said. The team focused on heavily trafficked fishing spots, like a 35-foot oval hole in Isle Bay that attracts gobs of ice anglers. “They didn’t find one piece of litter there,’’ West said. Other locations searched by divers or with an underwater drone included Big Point and Three-Mile Reef, both off the eastern shore. West said late Tuesday that he wanted to sample fishing areas on the north end of the lake, but might run out of time. Thursday is the last scheduled day for exploration. He said Mille Lacs might not have heavy concentrations of trash because there’s no consistency to the wind and waves like on other lakes. The varied contours of Mille Lacs, including its gravelly humps and expansive mud flats, also could play a role, he said. In Tahoe, for example, garbage was densely packed into shelf-like contours on the lake’s predictably windward side. He said his team’s observations underwater at Mille Lacs suggest that light litter is getting swept toward shore. “That makes sense to me,’’ he said. The junk recovered by divers tended to be heavy and resistant to getting pushed around, he said. “On our way here, I thought we could be pulling thousands of pounds of trash out,’’ West said. “So, it begs the question of ‘why not?’’' West, a certified divemaster and film producer, said he has other theories — such as junk could be buried in muck. Many bottom areas of Mille Lacs are covered in loose silt — so much so that walleye anglers routinely deploy special rigs that keep bottom-bouncing lures from getting obscured by dust-ups. West said one diver submerged his arm up to his armpit without touching anything but silt. Another theory, West said, is that the majority of anglers who fish on Mille Lacs are just good stewards. He also noted that underwater surveys of Mille Lacs will always be of the needle-in-a-haystack variety because visibility is poor and the lake is vast. Apart from finding trash, his divers were amazed by the concentrations of invasive zebra mussels. They’d pick up an item from the floor shaped like a discarded bottle or another piece of trash, only to realize it was a rock completely covered in mussels. “The zebra mussels are to a level we’ve never seen,’’ he said. But, he said, his “overall take’' about submerged litter in Mille Lacs is that the lake is “substantially cleaner than we thought it would be.’’ Chad Anderson of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency said his agency approved the grant in part because no one had previously assessed Mille Lacs for underwater trash. Providing education and raising public awareness about water quality were two other reasons to underwrite the pilot project, he said. “This was kind of a first crack ... an assessment,’’ Anderson said. “If they find tons of garbage, then let’s remove it.’’ In Prior Lake and perhaps other locations across the state, scuba diving for trash isn’t new. Steve Reinders is a board member of the Prior Lake Association who coordinates the group’s annual Dive the Lake Cleanup. Self-funded with the help of private sponsors and volunteers, the event relies on local divers, boat owners and a local marina one morning every June. “Last year we pulled up half a boat and we’ve pulled out a whole bunch of telephone poles,’’ Reinders said. At least one snowmobile has been recovered along with common items such as cell phones, sunglasses, boat covers, tires, rims and boat anchors. “You never get all the junk out of the lake,’’ Reinders said. “But it’s also a public awareness tool.’’ At Mille Lacs, Lyon said she and others will be considering how to focus future cleanup efforts.",
