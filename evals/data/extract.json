The Yellow Medicine County Sheriff’s Office was called for a welfare check at a house near Clarkfield, south of Montevideo, on Saturday afternoon, the agency said in a news release. When officers arrived, the man they meant to check on fled into a farm field with a rifle, the release said. Sheriff’s deputies rushed neighbors out of the house next to the field and said the man pointed his rifle at them before running into the just-vacated house. Deputies surrounded the house and tried to talk to the man but called a SWAT team when they could not persuade him to come outside. Members of the Kandiyohi-Meeker-Willmar SWAT team arrived and also tried to talk the person out of the house. The man fired at the SWAT team, according to the Sheriff’s Office. A SWAT team member shot back, hitting the man in the leg, but the standoff continued. Two other SWAT teams relieved the Kandiyohi-Meeker-Willmar group after about eight hours, according to the Sheriff’s Office. Just after 6 a.m. Sunday, the man left the house and shot a long gun at the SWAT teams. Another SWAT team member shot back and hit the man. He was taken to HCMC by helicopter and was stable on Sunday afternoon. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will investigate the use of force.",

According to the criminal complaint, Nathan Mellstrom Matz fired numerous shots with an AK-47 rifle sometime before 4:30 a.m. Saturday at the apartment building, in the 4000 block of Minnehaha Avenue in the Longfellow community. Several 911 calls summoned the police, who evacuated residents before finding Matz in a stairwell holding the rifle. An officer gave Matz a minute and 20 seconds to drop the gun before firing a single shot at him. The suspect was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where he was expected to survive his wound. No one else was injured in the episode. One resident told police he heard gunfire, stepped out in the hall and ran back into his apartment when he saw the gunman down the hall, who fired and nearly hit him. Another resident said he heard gunshots through his floor and found bullet holes there. A homeowner across the street said her house was hit by bullets and that she believed it was targeted during the shooting. Matz is charged with three counts of second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon, but prosecutors may seek an aggravated sentence because, among other things, the shooting occurred in a densely populated area.",

        "input": "Headline: Video: Boy, 10, jailed and charged with stealing car, driving through crowded Minneapolis playground\nText: A 10-year-old boy who has been suspected in a variety of crimes, including robbery and auto theft, has been arrested and charged after police say he recklessly drove a stolen car across a crowded Minneapolis school playground, narrowly missing multiple children. The boy was booked Thursday into the Hennepin County Juvenile Detention Center on suspicion of second-degree assault in connection with what happened at the playground about 11:45 a.m. on Sept. 20, a school day, outside Nellie Stone Johnson Community School in the 800 block of 27th Avenue N., police said. Friday’s charges allege reckless driving and receiving stolen property. Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the boy also was charged with threats of violence and attempt to commit an auto theft related to an August incident, when he wielded a knife and threatened a female motorist, allegedly telling her, “I will gut you.” Police records indicate that the boy, whose identity is being withheld by law enforcement because of his age, has at least 30 contacts with police dating to May 2023. He has been arrested at least twice before for auto theft-related crimes, according to police. He’s also listed as a suspect in more than 12 cases that range from auto theft to robbery to assault with a dangerous weapon. The remaining entries are mostly related to cases involving running away, police said. Police records say one of the boy’s auto thefts occurred late last year when he was 9 years old and stood 5 feet tall. The boy’s mother told the Star Tribune that her son was due in court Friday afternoon on allegations of stealing the car and “assaulting the person whose car it was.” The Star Tribune is not identifying her in order to protect the boy’s identity. The woman, who lives in Minneapolis, acknowledged that her son steals cars, “but why he does it, I don’t know. He doesn’t come from a bad home. I’m a single mom. His father passed away.” She pointed to “kids who are in the community who are older and getting him into that. He’s traumatized by these older kids. ... I want my son to get help. He’s a 10-year-old kid.” In a news conference Friday with the playground as a backdrop, O’Hara expressed concern about the increasingly younger offenders officers are encountering. Kia and Hyundai thefts by teens have escalated to more serious crimes in recent years, he said. A Hyundai was stolen in this case. “This is a situation where a mother — who I believe is a good parent — has been asking the system for help and the system has been failing her and been failing her child,” the chief said. “It’s disappointing to the community that when the police do bring someone like this in … that the system doesn’t have an answer for what to do with someone this young.” O’Hara blasted a state law set to take effect in 2026 that raises the minimum age of delinquency from 10 to 13. He encouraged people to call their state representatives and ask that they reverse the law before it kicks in, “simply as a matter of public safety.” The chief said the boy’s mother refers to the juvenile system as “the devil’s playground because kids are not seeing consequences and, in her words, they’re doing this for entertainment and not being held accountable.” O’Hara said police will sometimes refer troubled children to child protective services, but said that was not appropriate in this particular case. ”This is not an issue of the parent being neglectful,” he said. O’Hara and Lt. Kelly O’Rourke, who oversees MPD’s juvenile division, bemoaned the lack of suitable placement options for youths, where they can be safely detained while undergoing mental health evaluations and intensive treatment. “It’s a loophole in the system,” O’Rourke said. ”The kids are bankrupting the system by continuing to complete more and more crimes while they’re waiting for these providers to reach them out in the environment.” In the school playground incident, the boy drove the car on the grass and sidewalk between the school and the playground, where the kindergartners were enjoying a sunny day, according to police. Surveillance video released Friday by police shows school staff frantically trying to move children off the playground and out of harm’s way as the car buzzes close by multiple times. The boy’s head is barely visible just above the bottom of the driver’s side window of the 2013 Hyundai, a model that’s been a favorite of thieves for several years. O’Hara said in a statement that the 10-year-old’s family is cooperating with police and has asked for help to keep the boy or anyone else from being injured or killed. “It is unfathomable that a 10-year-old boy has been involved in this level of criminal activity without effective intervention,” O’Hara’s statement read. “Prison is not an acceptable option for a 10-year-old boy. But the adults who can stop this behavior going forward must act now to help this child and his family. “This is only one example of the revolving door we’re dealing with — arresting and rearresting the same juveniles for auto theft and other violent crimes. This is a complex issue, and we need every entity involved in intervention to come together immediately to establish short- and long-term solutions.” Later Friday, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said in a statement that the boy has been charged “because of the very significant safety implications both for this child and the broader community.” While the statement from County Attorney Mary Moriarty’s office announcing the charges in juvenile court said the law prevents prosecutors from saying more about this case, a person, including a child, cannot be prosecuted if they are not capable of understanding the legal proceedings or assisting their lawyer in their defense. A court-appointed psychologist makes a recommendation on competency to a judge, and the judge makes the decision. If a child is found not competent by the court, the case must be dismissed or suspended, and the child must be released from custody. “We are facing an urgent crisis in our community related to a small group of children who are not competent to stand trial in the juvenile justice system, but who cannot safely be at home,” the statement continued. “We are actively engaged with law enforcement, as well as county and state partners, about the critical need for safe and appropriate out-of-home placements for children with these complex needs who require specialized care. We cannot charge or prosecute our way out of this crisis. “What we need is clear: residential placements with varying levels of security in our community that are resourced and staffed to be able to accept and successfully treat our youth with complex needs. And we need urgent and immediate action to address this issue now.”",

        "input": "Headline: Suspect in fatal shooting of 2 on same day near Minneapolis homeless encampments charged in one killing\nText: A longtime street gang member was charged Friday with fatally shooting a man near a Minneapolis homeless encampment, believed to be his second such killing of the day, and then wounding another man near a different encampment hours later. Joshua Anthony Jones, 36, of Bemidji, was charged in Hennepin County District Court with second-degree murder in connection with the shooting of Robert Milton Brown, 39, of Minneapolis, around 4:15 p.m. Wednesday in an alley in the 2500 block of Bloomington Avenue S. About three hours later, prosecutors say, Jones shot a man 24th Street and 18th Avenue S. Jones is charged with second-degree attempted murder in that incident. Officers arrested Jones within 15 minutes of his third alleged shooting of the day. Police also believe that Jones is the gunman who killed Roland Scott Littleowl, 20, who died after being shot in the head about 4:40 a.m. in an alley in the 2500 block of 17th Avenue S. The shooting also left a man in his 30s wounded, police said. The three shootings spanned less than 15 hours, occurred within a several-block perimeter and involved the victims’ heads being targeted. The charges are unclear how well the men might have known Jones. The charges also did not address a motive for the shootings. Jones remains jailed in lieu of $1 million bail and awaits a court date for the cases filed Friday. Court records do not list an attorney for him. He’s due in court Monday regarding an assault charge alleging that he shot a man near a south Minneapolis light-rail station in March. Prosecutors said in Friday’s charges that Jones has been a longtime member of the Native Mob street gang that is active in south Minneapolis and elsewhere in Minnesota. His criminal history includes convictions for assault and fleeing police. “Although the investigation is ongoing, it appears that Mr. Jones targeted several individuals over a short time span, taking two lives and harming three other victims,” County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement. Moriarty added that although these attacks do not appear to be targeting people because they are homeless, “we know that that is little comfort to them. Everyone deserves to feel safe, housed or not, and our office will work to ensure that they do.” She said further investigation is underway that could lead to more charges being filed against Jones. On Thursday, Mayor Jacob Frey vowed to accelerate the destruction of the encampments and called out the fentanyl crisis as a major factor. Also on Thursday, the Minneapolis City Council approved measures related to housing and homelessness: a new set of reporting requirements intended to add transparency to camp removals, including where individuals land after being dispersed; a $1.5 million rehabilitation grant to help a downtown shelter make needed repairs; and an extension of the pre-eviction notification period for renters from 14 days to 30 days. According to the latest charges against Jones: Officers were dispatched to a shooting in the alley late in the afternoon and saw Brown had been shot in the head. Emergency medical providers declared him dead at the scene. One 9-millimeter cartridge casing was next to his body. Police reviewed surveillance video and saw that Brown “was standing peacefully in the alley” before Jones pointed a handgun at Brown’s head at close range, the charges said. Brown “put his hands up, bent his knees and hips, and cowered on the ground,” according to the charges. Jones paused for a moment, then shot Brown in the head, sending his victim face-up to the pavement. Jones uttered a racial epithet and walked away. Then about 7:20 p.m., a 34-year-old man was hunted down by Jones until the victim was shot in the back of his right shoulder near 24th Street and 18th Avenue S. The man said he was fixing the chain on his bicycle and saw Jones arrive in an SUV. He recognized Jones from past interactions, including drug dealing. Jones hollered a racial epithet, approached the man from behind and aimed a gun at his head. The man jumped just as Jones fired one shot. The man started running, and Jones chased him while continuing to shoot. Jones finally hit the man in the shoulder while the man was hiding behind a vehicle. An earlier shot grazed the man’s head. The man took off running again, this time until taking cover in a park building. Jones gave up the chase at that point. Shortly after 7:30 p.m., officers found Jones and arrested him at gunpoint. Discharged cartridge casings at all three shooting scenes were analyzed and they appear to come from the same gun.",

        "input": "Headline: Republicans hoping to win in Minnesota focus on state Legislature\nText: For hours every afternoon, Wayne Johnson crisscrosses subdivision streets, knocking on doors and ringing doorbells, leaving leaflets in screen door handles and sometimes giving his pitch to voters. Johnson, a Republican running for the Legislature in a hotly contested open seat in the east metro against DFLer Lucia Wroblewski, is largely working on his own around Lake Elmo and Afton. He’s relying on a list of voters supplied by the state Republican Party with no army of volunteers, just one other person, and putting a lot of miles on his slip-on Skechers shoes. He says he tries to engage with everyone, without regard for party affiliation. “I talk to everybody,” he said. “Let’s have a conversation.” For Republicans and the groups supporting them, a bout of early-summer optimism about flipping the state for former President Donald Trump has narrowed to the ambition of winning back the state House of Representatives by flipping a few districts. Yet Minnesota Republican Party State Chair David Hann insists the Trump campaign has not given up on the state. “The Trump campaign has been very interested in Minnesota,” Hann said. “They have been heavily engaged and continue to be so. They believe it’s a winnable race, I believe it is too.” Others aren’t so sure the Trump campaign is still engaged. “The national campaign can tend to be focused more on other states than Minnesota,” said Jake Coleman, senior adviser of Americans for Prosperity Action in Minnesota, a libertarian-leaning group that does not coordinate with candidates. Only a few months ago, Republicans were optimistic about their chances in Minnesota, even before President Joe Biden’s poor debate performance. Despite a major cash advantage for the Minnesota DFL over the Minnesota Republican Party, there were exploitable fractures. An unpopular incumbent wasn’t too exciting for Democrats. Some progressives were demoralized by his support for Israel’s war in Gaza, and almost 46,000 Democrats cast “uncommitted” primary ballots in protest. More than 22,000 others voted for Rep. Dean Phillips or self-help author Marianne Williamson. The Trump campaign signaled seriousness about Minnesota when James Blair, the campaign’s political director, wrote in a memo in June that it would open eight offices in the state in July. By the end of the summer, the Trump campaign claimed 13 offices in Minnesota. But most of those are Republican county or congressional offices doing double-duty as Trump campaign offices, some with just a small Trump sign or two in the window along with larger signs for the local congressional races. The offices are low-key, one in an alley behind a liquor store on the outskirts of Mankato and another in an out-of-the-way Lakeville office park without any Trump or Republican Party signage. In those offices, the Republican Party says it’s trained 1,400 “Trump Force” volunteer captains, with 400 of them trained in just the last two weeks. On the other side, the DFL Coordinated Campaign and the Harris campaign said they have 24 offices and more than 100 paid staff members. They’ve signed up 14,000 volunteers since the end of July, knocked on 100,000 doors and made 67,000 phone calls. Hann was skeptical about Democrats’ reports of voter contacts and volunteers — numbers that, unlike campaign finance information, do not have to be verified with any regulator. “It’s in the category of rumors and talk,” Hann said. If it is true, Democrats’ push has not yet had a huge impact on public opinion in Minnesota, he said. “If this was all as great as Democrats are telling you, they’d be way up in the polls,” Hann said. Americans for Prosperity, the libertarian-leaning group that supports Republican candidates, is sitting out the presidential race. Instead, it is focusing its efforts on 14 legislative races, with plans to canvass neighborhoods just about daily until the election. Coleman said a mix of paid staff and volunteers aim to contact between 300,000 and 400,000 Minnesota voters by Election Day. “It’s a lot of pounding the pavement” to get out information about their preferred candidates, Coleman said. The pressure is on, he said, because some of the races that delivered Democrats their current state government trifecta were won by just a couple hundred votes. Hann would not discuss specifics of where the state GOP is focusing its efforts or how many voters it hopes to contact by Election Day, saying he did not want to tip his hand to Democrats, but said the party is targeting its on-the-ground contacts with voters on a handful of legislative races. “Everybody knows if Republicans win an additional four seats they become the majority,” he said. But he said the party is interested in competing further up the ballot too. “We want to win them all,” Hann said. For Americans for Prosperity’s part, Coleman said he didn’t think the group has the resources to make a dent in congressional races, much less against Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar. “I don’t think we could put in the resources necessary to push those over the edge,” he said, even if he thought a race could be won. In races in which his group is involved, Coleman said, it seems the candidates themselves are doing most of the work. “I haven’t heard a lot about the state party or the Trump campaign,” Coleman said. First-time candidate Josh Jungling, a Republican running in a Coon Rapids and Anoka district against DFL Rep. Zack Stephenson, said he has gotten some helpful pointers from the House Republican Campaign Committee, the arm of the state party working on legislative races. “It’s all those little things when you’re starting to run for public office,” Jungling said. “Like, how do you put up a four-by-eight[-foot] sign?” Still, he said, the hard work of going door to door to persuade people to vote can be a little lonely for a legislative candidate. “There’s a lot of times you’re just out there by yourself just knocking on doors.”",

        "input": "Headline: No yard signs. No big donations or debates. These Minnesota political races are unlike many others.\nText: Most offices on the November ballot are familiar: president, senator, judge. But sandwiched between them is a role that often goes unnoticed, one where the race happens on paper but rarely in person. There’s almost no campaign spending. There are almost never yard signs. In the few instances when candidates do knock on doors, people tend to be confused. “I’ve lost count of the number of people that I’ve talked to who weren’t even aware that this was an organization,” said Danielle Holder, a candidate for soil and water supervisor within the Anoka Conservation District. “It doesn’t feel political. It almost feels like the most cordial race you could ever run.” Voters in most Minnesota counties will select soil and water supervisors this November. Soil and water conservation districts trace back to the 1930s, when Congress was hoping to rein in erosion in the aftermath of the Dust Bowl. Over the years, the districts’ work has expanded, with some taking on projects aimed at improving water quality or protecting rare, native plants. The volunteer supervisors serve as advisers for conservation districts, helping to decide which projects get priority for funding, keeping tabs on the organizations’ financials, and building connections within their local communities. “We create relationships with private landowners. We explain the benefits of programs and explain the dollar sources that are available to them,” said Chuck Rau, a supervisor in Benton County and board president for the Minnesota Association of Soil & Water Conservation Districts. Rau is up for re-election this year, running unopposed. Candidates on the ballot this year include farmers, a real estate attorney, a former school nurse, and a parks and recreation worker, among others. Many run unopposed, a testament to the position’s low profile. But this year some races — including in Anoka and Dakota counties — have multiple candidates on the ballot. Colleen Werdien, a former school nurse, became a soil and water supervisor in Anoka County four years ago because she was concerned about the environment and what the world might look like in the future for her nieces and nephews. During her time representing westerns portions of the county, including Anoka and Nowthen, the conservation district has pursued projects aimed at strengthening the integrity of the banks of the Rum River and requested funding to improve the quality of groundwater. Holder, an attorney focusing on real estate issues, decided to run in the same district because she has been interested in environmental issues and has more free time now that her children are getting older. If elected, she hopes to improve outreach and help educate people about small changes they can make, such as planting native grasses in areas where traditional lawns aren’t growing well. Voters will choose between Werdien and Holder — but the pair are quick to point out that it’s been a friendly, relaxed election. “It’s a pretty low-key kind of campaign,” Werdien said, noting that they’ve been asked to appear at just one forum. Their race is hardly an anomaly in the world of soil and water supervisors. Sigrid Lindholm, who grew up on a dairy farm and now lives in Eagan, was surprised to learn that each race in Dakota County has drawn multiple candidates this year. She decided to run partly because she wants to model civic engagement for her daughters. “I see how it’s important for every homeowner, whether they’re living in a city or in the country, to take an active role in helping to preserve the land, helping to conserve water and just being mindful of the actions we take,” Lindholm said. Lindholm is running in a district that includes Eagan and part of Apple Valley. Mark Vaughan is running in a different district that covers the eastern portions of Dakota County, including Hastings and areas to the south. The incumbents they’re facing, Brian Raney and Kevin Chamberlain, didn’t respond to messages from the Minnesota Star Tribune. If selected for soil and water supervisor, Vaughan said he wants to see if there are ways to strengthen efforts to protect water quality. He works in Eagan’s Parks and Recreation Department and spent eight years on the Hastings City Council before deciding not to run for re-election there. After two years away, Vaughan said he has “an itch to get back into policymaking.” But he also wants it to be in a nonpartisan role. “I think it’s today’s society,” Vaughan said. “I just wasn’t ready to be picking a side. I think it’s too divided.”",

A 34-page workplace conduct investigation, released last month, included a similar summary of the current Robbinsdale school board: Personal disputes and cross-complaints among at least six of the seven board members resulted in “a high level of dysfunction and animosity in the school board’s operations,” read the investigative report by Red Cedar Consulting. Most of the allegations in the report were not sustained. Of those that were sustained, most qualified as violations of the board’s internal values of respect. Seven candidates are now vying for three open seats on that board. Six of them — Barbara Breher, Greta Evans-Becker, Aviva Hillenbrand, Aileen White, Deborah Campion and Kenneth Wutoh — say moving past that discord would be their top priority if elected. “We didn’t need an investigator to let us know that we were dysfunctional,” said Evans-Becker, the other incumbent running to keep her seat. “A lot of harm has been done, but we have to move past it.” Evans-Becker was the only board member who wasn’t named in the multiple complaints included in the investigative report.

Robbinsdale Area Public Schools has about 10,400 students and serves all or parts of Brooklyn Center, Brooklyn Park, Crystal, Golden Valley, New Hope, Plymouth and Robbinsdale. Its current superintendent, Teri Staloch, took on the role in July after a failed superintendent search to replace David Engstrom, who resigned in September 2023. An August board meeting to discuss the investigation’s findings devolved into back-and-forth accusations, both old and new, and two motions to censure members. By the end, Board Member Sharon Brooks was censured on a 4-2 vote after widespread confusion about rules of order. “I hate that our school district is now known for a dysfunctional school board as opposed to all the great things that happen,” said Hillenbrand, who works for Minneapolis Community Education. Hillenbrand has two children in Robbinsdale schools and one who graduated from the district. White works as a data specialist in Hopkins schools and started paying attention to school board meetings when her children, now graduated, attended Robbinsdale schools. She wants to see more community involvement and conversation between families and district leaders and worries that the board dysfunction has distracted from that mission. “I hope that the participation of people voting for school board members speaks volumes to Robbinsdale and the board that people are watching,” White said. Campion, who is retired, said she’s “appalled” to see what’s happened to the school board and wants members to be leading conversations about district finances and improving transportation. She worked as a teacher in Australia in the late 1970s and as a substitute teacher in North Dakota before changing careers. Breher, who works for HealthPartners in member services, agreed and said the frustration of watching the board squabble for 20 minutes about rules of order, for example, helped push her to run for a seat. “I think some fresh ideas, fresh — and respectful conversations — are needed to move forward,” she said. Without a functioning school board, Breher worries that enrollment will dip and the district will look less attractive to new teachers. Wutoh, a physical therapist and parent in the district, agreed. Whether it’s one or three new faces on the board, he said he’s hopeful that the election will bring “renewed energy and focus to not make disagreements become personal.” “The seven people at that table need to remember the main reason why they are elected to be there, which is to make sure our kids become successful.”",

        "input": "Headline: Minnesota Poll: Walz is a polarizing figure for Minnesotans\nText: Minnesotans of different political stripes vary dramatically in how they believe DFL Gov. Tim Walz handled the COVID-19 pandemic and the riots after the police murder of George Floyd, and remain divided now that he is running to become vice president. The latest Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll found 53% of those surveyed said they approved of how Walz has done as governor, while 44% disapproved. Voters who did not identify with either major political party were slightly more likely to have an unfavorable opinion of Walz’s job performance. The poll’s findings are based on interviews with 800 likely Minnesota voters conducted from Sept. 16 to Sept. 18. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. (Scroll to the end of this article for full results for each question. Click here for the poll methodology, a demographic breakdown of the sample and a map of the poll regions.) But respondents were almost equally divided on whether they view the governor favorably as he runs on Vice President Kamala Harris’ ticket. Forty-eight percent had a favorable opinion of Walz, while 47% were unfavorable. Walz’s opponent for vice president, Republican Sen. JD Vance, is similarly polarizing for Minnesotans, with 91% of Democrats seeing him unfavorably, and 93% of Republicans favorable. Independent voters are split on both Walz and Vance. Half of the politically independent respondents have an unfavorable view of Walz, with 42% approving and 8% unsure. For Vance, 45% disapprove, 40% approve and 16% are not sure what they think of the Ohio senator. Looking back at 2020, 52% of poll respondents said they approved of the way Walz handled the COVID-19 pandemic, and 46% disapproved. Meanwhile, 44% of respondents approved of how Walz handled the protests and riots after Floyd’s murder, and 52% disapproved. Those who approve of Walz said they see him as a dedicated public servant who did well in the face of the pandemic and the protests. “I think he did as good a job as could be expected,” said Bill Engels of St. Louis Park, even if, in hindsight, he thinks some of the COVID restrictions could have been a little more lax. As for the riots in Minneapolis, Engels said he thought Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey deserved a share of the blame for how long it took to call in the National Guard, and said he believed there were both left- and right-wing agitators who were only too happy to see property destruction. Charles Dolson, a Bemidji attorney who grew up on the Red Lake Reservation, said Walz has done a “phenomenal job” as governor and hopes Walz writes a book about his tenure during the pandemic to provide future state executives with a roadmap. Even among Democrats, fewer think Walz handled the 2020 protests well than approve of him overall, though the overwhelming majority of Democrats still think he did a good job. Just over 80% of Democratic respondents approved of the way Walz handled the protests, compared to 94% who approve overall of the job he’s done as governor. Those who do not support him see 2020 very differently. “We had a riot on the George Floyd situation and he did nothing about it,” said Wayne Charles of Kenyon. “I think he’s the poorest governor we’ve had in my lifetime, and I’m 90 years old.” Independent voters in Minnesota were divided on Walz’ handling of the protests. Half of those interviewed disapproved, compared to 42% who approved and 8% who are not sure. Opinions on Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who would succeed Walz if he is elected vice president, are still largely unknown, with 47% of respondents saying they were not sure if they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of her. Even among Democrats, almost a third said they were not sure what they thought. Staff writer Rochelle Olson contributed to this report. FULL RESULTS The Star Tribune, MPR News and KARE 11 interviewed 800 Minnesota registered voters between Sept. 16 and Sept. 18, 2024. All indicated they are likely to vote in the November general election. Findings from questions about Tim Walz’s tenure as governor, GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance and Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan are below. Totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

        "input": "Headline: Voters in New Hope and Zumbro Falls received incorrect ballots for House races\nText: Several Minnesota communities are dealing with misprinted ballots after early voting opened Friday for the Nov. 5 election. Hennepin County voters in House District 43A received absentee ballots with the incorrect middle initial for Rep. Cedrick Frazier,  a DFLer, who is running for re-election against Republican challenger Todd Hesemann. Some ballots have Frazier’s middle initial as “B” when it should be listed as “R.” When ballots are misprinted, the Minnesota Supreme Court has to sign off on whatever fix state and local officials propose. In Frazier’s case, the Secretary of State’s office plans to count the ballots with the incorrect initial normally. “Every year stuff like this pops up and every year there are procedures in place to correct it,” said Peter Bartz-Gallagher,  communications director for Secretary of State Steve Simon. On Wednesday evening, Hennepin County election officials acknowledged 28 of the 55,000 absentee ballots they recently sent out were missing the ovals voters fill in, due to a printing error. Elections officials say voters can ask for a new ballot, mark their existing ballot in an obvious way or vote in person at an early voting location or on Election Day. In March, the Hennepin County Board approved a $1.6 million, five-year contract with BlueCrest to automate absentee ballot mailing. County officials send out more than 100,000 ballots during the general election to residents who vote absentee. On Tuesday, Wabasha County officials said voters in Zumbro Falls received mail-in ballots with the District 20A House candidates when they should be voting in the District 20B race. Michael Plante, Wabasha County administrator, said county officials will issue corrected ballots to the affected precinct after the state Supreme Court signs off. Ballots with the errors will be “spoiled” and will not be used in the election. “Wabasha County understands that public trust in the election process is vital and we are working to address this issue as quickly as possible,” Plante said in a statement. Rep. Steve Jacob, R-Altura, represents District 20B which includes Zumbro Falls. He is running for re-election against DFLer Michael Hutchinson. Rep. Pam Altendorf, R-Red Wing, represents District 20A and is running for re-election against Democrat Heather Arndt. “These errors are unacceptable and need to be quickly resolved by the Secretary of State and the County to ensure voters in Zumbro Falls aren’t disenfranchised,” Jacob and Altendorf said in a statement. Zumbro Falls has 155 residents, according to the U.S. Census, who vote entirely by mail. It is unclear how long it will take to correct the ballots. Last week, voters in Faribault County House District 23A received ballots that switched the political affiliation for Rep. Peggy Bennett, a Republican, and DFL challenger Joe Staloch. That error affected only 17 ballots issued by Faribault County, Simon’s office said in a statement Sept. 20. Ballots for the District 23A race from Freeborn, Steele and Waseca counties are accurate. The statement noted that Minnesota’s 87 counties prepare their ballots after they receive a certified list of candidate names and party affiliations from the Secretary of State.",
